CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[5 36

36. Nec vero corpori solum subveniendum est, sed menti
atque animo multo magis; nam haec quoque, nisi tamquam

lumini oleum instilles, exstinguuntur senectute.

Et corpora

Nam quos ait Caecilius5

‘co'mz’cos stztlto's senes‚’ hos significat credulos, obliviosos,
dissolutos, quae vitia sunt non senectutiS‚ sed inertis, igna-

lius, 11, 2, 6) 3 cf. on 36, 43 this is
from his Carmen de Moribus3 cf.
Intr.‚ ξ 40.—13. tantum . . . ut:
‘only so much . . . that.'

36. 2. haec: i.e. mens and ani-
mus, hence neuter. — 2. tam-
quam lumini oleum: incomplete
comparison ς translate tamquam
by ‘as it were,' ‘so to speak.'-—
3. instilles: cf. 21, 1.—4. ingra-
vescunt: cf. Cato himself: Item

thing scarcely deserving to be

saying I have no need to refute,

comic stage,' or ‘of the comedy)
In the later Greek and Roman
comedies, old men are constant
subjects of ridicule, deceived by
their sons and outwitted by their
slaves (cf. credulos). Cf. Varro,
Sat. Men. 51, Biich. :

Scae'na quem senem Latina vidit
derz'sissimum.

—6. hos significat credulos: for
the two-accusative construction,
cf. Quem enim intellegimus divi-
tem? (Parad. 42): ‘VVhom do
we mean by the rich man? ⁹ Puto,
duco, habeo (‘ consider '), emklimo,
are used in the same way, on the
analogy of verbs of naming.—
