CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

Tusculum,¹ some two thousand feet above the sea, on the
heights which overhang the Latin Way, a dozen miles from
Rome. His youth, however, was spent in hard labor on
the stony farm of his father in the Sabine mountains.2
From a sturdy, but undistinguished family he received a
goodly heritage of manly qualities and native force, be-
neath, an unattractive exterior.³ Born in the interval of
peace with Carthage, he grew up amid the memories of
the First Punic War, and gave himself heart and soul to
the supreme efforts of the Second, entering the army at
seventeen, in the dark days after the disaster at Lake
Trasimene, in 217.4 Of his service as a private Cato ⁴is
made to speak in ξ 10 of this dialogue, while his biogra-
pher, Plutarch, lavishes the highest praises upon his virtues
as a soldier.⁵

23. Promotion to the military tribuneship came only
after years of the hardest service. Cornelius Nepos makes ,
him already tribune (in Sicily) in 214,⁶ but, according to

urbis nostrae . . . LXXXV suo). In Cato alaier, 14, Cato is represented
as sixty-five in the year in which Ennius died (169), nineteen years before the
date of the dialogue (cf. 32, 1); while in Brutus, 80, Cicero speaks of him as
eighty-five at the time of his death. Both Livy (39, 40, 12) and Plutarch
(Cato, 1 5 fin.) make Cato ninety years old. Is he died in 149 B.c., this would
give 239 as the year of his birth, and his first military service at the age of
seventeen would fall in 222. But this is four years before Hannibal invaded
Italy, whereas Plutarch (cap. 1) distinctly associates his service in the army
with the early campaigns of the Second Punic VVar.

⁸ Plut. l.c., on his red hair and gray-green eyes.

⁴ Nepos, Cato, ι, 2, says his service began at seventeen, and the statement
was taken from Cato‘s own words, according to Plut., Cato, 1 fin.

⁵ Plut., Cato, 1. In the epic of Silius Italicus, ιο, 14, Cato is present at
the battle of Cannae —perhaps a piece of imagination simply; but Silius was
a pedant, and not likely to run eounter to known facts.

⁶ Nep„ Cato, 1, 2. If Cato shared the campaigns of Marcellus, Cicero’s
silence on this point is strange.
