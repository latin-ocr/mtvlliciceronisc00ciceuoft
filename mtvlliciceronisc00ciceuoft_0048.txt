CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

is found by some in (3) a happy tone which they discover
in the dialogue as a whole,—his joy, at the downfall of
the tyrant‚ making Cicero feel younger than usual,—a
feeling which soon vanished, as is shown by the letter
just cited. For others the same theory is supported by
(4) the troubles briefly alluded to at the beginning, as

tation that these troubles, for which no remedy can be
found at present, are the anxieties felt by the two friends
as to the result of Antony’s conduct, — the tyranny which

only a remnant of his time for philosophical writing.1

that that book was already finished by the 15th March.
Hence the statement, Interiectus est etiam nuper liber is,
quem ad nostrum Atticum de senectute misimus-,² can only

de Divinatione, or was written before Cicero had reached
the second book. In either case, then, the Cato Maior is
proved to have been written before the death of Caesar,
by the very passage which has sometimes been thought to
prove the contrary.3

(2) If we look more closely at the letters to Atticus
already cited, we find them three in number, dated respec-
tively 11th May, 16th (17th) July‚ 5th November. The
last two simply express Cicero's gratification that the work
