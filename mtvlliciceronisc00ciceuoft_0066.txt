Ille vir leand magna cum re, sed plenus fidei ,-

quamquam certo scio non, ut Flamininum,

Sollicitari te, Tite, sic noctesque diesque ,-

novi enim moderationem animi tui et aequitatem teque non
10 cognomen solum Athenis deportasse, sed humanitatem et

as utut is ‘ howsoever,' so quam-

9, 5; 67,2; 69, 1); and by anal-

construction for te and me, as
though it were a tam . . . quam

must sooner or later pass. If that

man, however he may mourn for
the republic, will submit to the in-
