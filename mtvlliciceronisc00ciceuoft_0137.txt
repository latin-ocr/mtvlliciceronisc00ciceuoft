CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[ἒ 59-60

gemmis dixisse: ‘Rite vero te, Cyre, beatum ferunt, quo-
niam virtuti tuae fortuna coniuncta est.'

60. Hac igitur fortuna frui licet senibus, nec aetas im-
pedit quo minus et ceterarum rerum et in primis agri co-
lendi studia teneamus usque ad ultimum tempus senectutis.
M. quidem Valerium Corvinum accepimus ad centesimum
annum perduxisse, cum esset acta iarn aetate in agris eos· 5
que coleret; cuius inter primum et sextum consulatum sex

et quadraginta anni interfuerunt.

Ita, quantum spatium

aetatis maiores ad senectutis initium esse voluerunt, tantus
illi cursus honorum fuit; atque huius extrema aetas hoc

the sumptuousness of Persian
dress made a great impression
upon the Greeks.—21. auro . . .
’ gemmis: abl. of quality. —23. vir—
tuti . . . fortuna: in contrast with
the abstract employed by Cicero,
Xenophon (l.c. §25) had been
entirely concrete, ἀγαθὸς ’γὰρ ὢν
ἀνὴρ εὐδαιμονεῖς, a literal transla-
tion of which is impossible in
Latin, lacking as it does the pres.
ptcp. of esse.

60. Hac igitur fortuna: in close
connection with 59, 23: fortuna,
but also summing up all the hap-
piness to be found in the country
(31-59 inc.). A translation must
preserve the emphasis so impor-
tant in the opening words of a
concluding paragraph. —2. et cete-
rarum rerum et: cf. 59, 10.—
3. studia: ‘interest in' (singular
in English), or ‘pursuit of.'—
4. accepimus: cf. on 13, 7. The
example is cleverly used as an
easy transition to Cato's next

point, viz. auctoritas. — 5. perdux—
isse: the object is agri colendi
studia supplied from above. —
5. cum esset . . . coleret: the
clause is only the equivalent of a
pres. ptcp„ eg. ruri habitantem
agrosque colentem; cf. on 50, 4;
49, 9. —5. acta iam aetate: abl.
abs.; for the more usual exacta
aetate. — 6. sex et quadraginta:
by our reckoning (after Varro, not
Cato) it was 49 years (348-299).
Remarkable also was the interval
of 35 years between his fourth and
fifth consulships. — 8. ad senectutis
initium: the age of exemption
(46th year) marked the beginning
of the aetas senioris (45—60)‚ often
loosely reckoned with senectus,-
cf. on 4, 15. -9. cursus honorum:
‘ official career-³ The phrase usu-
ally includes all the offices held
in regular order. Here the lesser
offices (quaestorship‚ aedileship,
praetorship) are neglected as un-
worthy of mention in comparison
