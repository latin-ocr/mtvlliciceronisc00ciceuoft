CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

narrated the events of the First Punic War, preceded by
an outline of republican history to the beginning of the
struggle with Carthage,— unless we assume ¹ that this por-
tion of the history was interwoven with the Origines proper
of Books II and III. For some reason Cato included the
first three years of the Second Punic War, with the battle
of Cannae, in the fourth book.2 The fifth book completed
the Second Punic War, with subsequent events as far as
the final conquest of Macedonia. It also contained at
least one of Cato's own orations, inserted at its proper
place in the narrative.3 The last two books, the sixth and
seventh, continued the story with greater detail, and a more
liberal sprinkling, in all probability, of Cato’s speeches,⁴ to
the year of his death, 149. From the First Punic War
on, we are told that he omitted the names of the com-
manders.⁵ He found space, however, to mention places
and objects of interest in Italy and Spain.

something all his own. Avoiding the petty details of the

² For the contents of the books we are indebted chiefly to Nepos, Cato, 3,
3 ff. ; but quotations in later writers add not a little information. Thus the
story of Hannibal and Maharbal after the victory of Cannae was told by Cato
in quarto Originum, according to Gell. 2, 19, 9 ; cf. Cortese, p. 110.

¹ Jdrdasn, p. lviii, seems to think that only two orations were included in
the 0rz2gines; Genese, pp. 57-58, and Teuffel, ᾖ 120, 2, that there were
others.

⁵ Nepos, Cato, 3, 4; Plin„ N. H. 8, ιη Ricci, p. 28, extends this omission
of names to the entire work. Cf. Gell. 3, 7, where an abstract and a quotation
from Cato show such titles as imperator Poenus, consul, tribunus, instead of
names‚—in narrating an incident in the First Punic War (Jordan, p. 18 fl.;
cf. p. 17, fr. 4; p. 21, fr. 12). A list of consuls, proconsuls, etc„ at the be-
ginning of each year, might have enabled the painstaking reader to make
the necessary substitutions (cs. Nipperdey on Nepos, l.c.); but Cato had aban-
