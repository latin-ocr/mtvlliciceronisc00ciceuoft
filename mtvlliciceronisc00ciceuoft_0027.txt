INTRODUCFION

an atmosphere of imported books and foreign art, travel-
ling to the centres of Greek refinement, or living in the
memory of travel,—such men could no more reconstruct
in imagination the Rome of Fabius and Marcellus, in all
its vigorous simplicity and the narrowness of its strictly
Italian horizon, than they could see without distortion the
rugged character of a Cato. To them the dim Etruscan
past would have seemed scarcely more remote. The
broader their education, the more difficult was it for them
to conceive of the narrow-mindedness‚ the painfully limited
vision, of their own grandfathers. One may doubt whether
a-ny of Cicero's contemporaries of equal cultivation and
similar tastes could have believed that the real and un-
polished Cato had not only existed barely four generations
before, but was in reality a most favorable specimen of
the unschooled—-and unspoiled — Roman.1

18. Cicero’s admiration for the Roman republic, in a
time when it was to him the ideal form of government,
made him think of Cato as a statesman of breadth and
foresight, united with all other good men —even his dear-
est enemies, the Scipios—in unselfish service of the state.
Thus the ideal Cato (of this dialogue and elsewhere) feels
toward the Scipios2 as the real Cato never allowed himself
to feel. There is no suspicion here of that intense ani-
mosity, the incessant barking,—to use Livy's word,3—
which ended in forcing the greatest man of the day, the
deliverer from Hannibal, into the sullen retirement in which
he died:1

¹ Appreciation of the virtue that went with rustic simplicity was not lack-
ing; cf. Varro, Sat. Men. 63, Biich.: Avi et atavi nostri, cum alium ac caepe
eorum verba olerent, tamen optume animati erant.

² From the reference to Scipio the Elder in § 19, no one would suspect
the bitter hostility os the real Cato (cf. ἓξ 61 and 82).
