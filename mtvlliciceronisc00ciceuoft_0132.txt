M. TVLLI CICERONIS

A villa in senatum arcessebatur et Curius et

ceteri senes, ex quo, qui eos arcessebant, viatores nominati

sunt.

Num igitur horum senectus miserabilis fuit qui se

agri cultione oblectabant? Mea quidem sententia haud
10 scio an nulla beatior possit esse, neque solum officio, quod
hominum generi universo cultura agrorum est salutaris,
sed et delectatione, qua dixi, et saturitate copiaque rerum
omnium, quae ad victum hominum, ad cultum etiarn deo-
rum pertinent, ut, quoniam haec quidam desiderant, in

15 gratiam iam cum voluptate redeamus.

Catiline without trial. Ahala was
accounted a liberator rei publicae ,·
cf. Livy, 4, 14, 7.—-6. A villa in
senatum: the abandonment of
country life for the city had been
slow among the early Romans.
The vir bonus had been identical
with the bonus agricola (Cato,
R. R. prooem. 2). Many distin—
guished names preserved to a late
date the memory of rustic ances-
tors‚ e-g- Porcius, Ovinius, Asi-
nius, Asina, Taurus, Vz'tulus (cf.
Varro, R. R. 2, 1, 10).—‘7. via-
tores : the same explanation is given
by Columella, 1, praes. 19, and
Pliny, N. H. 18, 21.—8. horum:
first person3 zze. of those I have
mentioned as amusing themselves
with agriculture.—9. cultione:
very rare for cultura ‚· first in
Cicero, and after him not again
until the end of the third century.
9. haud scio an nulla: ‘am in-
clined to believe that none'3 or
more briefly, ‘ there is perhaps
none'3 cf. 73, 73 74, 6.-

Semper enim boni

10. officio: ‘in respect to prac-
tical service '; for there is a part
to perform, and a useful one.—
12. sed : the usual etiam is omitted,
as often in Cicero. —12. et . . .
et: ‘as well . . . as,' —to balance
the pure pleasure of farming
against the store of good things
produced, and prepare the way for
his reconciliation with voluptas.
-ια, qua: not for quam (a kind
of attraction used by some other
writers, but not by Cicero, except
with a preceding demonstrative).
It is a case of ellipsis, qua [eam
quemvis delectare] dixi. Cf. App.
—13· ad cultum . . . deorum: i-e.
by providing first-fruits‚ victims
for sacrifice, wine for libations.
Cato's book on farming has much
to say about religious ceremonias,
especially in chaps. 83, 132, 134,
¹39 ff.; cf.1ntr.‚§42.—14. nt . . .
redeamus: may be taken as result,
but better as the purpose, not of
anything expressed, but of the
speaker in thus expressing him-
