Iucundum potius quam odiosum!

pire itself ; cf. Cat. 4, 7 : haec delere,
i.e. delere imperium3 pro Sall. 32 ;
Na'gelsbach, Stilzstzkss, p. 201.—
4. prodere: regular in this sense of
⁶ hand down,' ‘ bequeath ' by direct
inheritance3 cf. pro Milone, 83:
maiorum sapientia, qui sacra, qui
caerimonias, qui auspicia et ipsi
sanctissime coluerunt et nobis, suis
posteris, prodzderunt. The farm
has been received as it were on
trust, though Cicero avoids the
legal terms applied to a trust (de-
positum, commodatam, and preca-
rium, to which the verb is not
prodo, but reddo or restituo). —-
6. illud: looking forward to the
quotation, as usua13 cf. l. 11. -
6. idem: sc. ait‚· the mention of
Statius (Caecilius) suggests two
other utterances of the same poet,
which bear on the general subject
of old age, but are not strictly in
place at this point of the argument.
Without waiting for a more suit-

able context, Cato digresses far
enough to 'convict Caecilius of
error. The verses in both cases
are iambic senarii. An old man
complains, as often on the Roman
stage, of the burden of his years.—
7. nil quicquam: old Latin3 cf. L.
2402.—8. adportes. . . est: future
general condition, of a form much
more frequent where the second
person of the protasis is indefinite.
—9· videt: sc. senex from senec-
tus (cf. in the next quotation: in
senecta . . . eumpse) ; but the tran-
sition to the person was already
suggested in vivendo, which takes
the place of a dum-clause or pres.
ptcp.: cf. on 24, 4. With an in-
definite subject in the singular the
second person is usually preferred
to the third, which is, however,
very common in old laws. — 10. Et
multa: as though Cato were reply-
ing directly to Caecilius ς cs. 27, 8 :
Non vera—14. eumpse: several
