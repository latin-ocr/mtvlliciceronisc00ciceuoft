tibicine, quae sibi nullo exemplo privatus sumpserat; tan-

45. Sed quid ego alios? ad me ipsum iam revertar.
Primum habui semper sodales; sodalitates autem me quaes-
tore constitutae sunt sacris Idaeis Magnae Matris acceptis.

the boyhood of Cato. — 12. cereo
funali: a twisted taper coated with
wax. —13. tibicine: the flute-
player was to be found at every
sacrifice or funeral, often at feasts.
—13- privatus: z'.e. although not
a magistrate. The right to be
attended by a taper-bearer and
a flute-player on the return from a
feast was confined to magistrates,
cf. Servius on Vei-g„ Aen. 1, 727
(speaking of small or hand-cande-
labra): quae interdum erant mi-
nora, ut gestari mann et praeferri
mageis-tratibus a cena remeantibus
possent. — 13. sumpserat: what
was assumed, if we trust Cicero,
without precedent or authority,
was according to Livy a privilege
duly conferred upon the hero
of that naval victory : ob quam
causam ei perpetuus qnoque Itonos
habitus est, ut revertenti a cena
tibicine canente funale praeferre-
ίμν (per. 17). Valerius Maximus
evades the question, but adds a
fidicen (3, 6, 4).

45. Sed quid ego alios ἲ sc. com-
memoro,· on the revocatio, cf. 3, 10.
—1. ad me: cf. 32, 1.—-2. Pri-
mum: to contrast club dinners
with private affairs (note quoque,
46, 2). — 2. sodales: the members
of any collegium (priestly‚ or other-

111

wise) were sodales or collegae: cf.
Gaius (ngr. 47, 22, 4): Sodales
sunt, qui eiusdem collegr'i sunt.
The Arval Brothers were such a
society.—2. sodalitates: or col-
legr'a,· not in this case like the
priestly colleges, but still associ-
ated with a cult,—tl1at of the
newly imported goddess, in whose
honor these clubs held feasts. —
2. me quaestore: 204 13.c.; cf.
10, 8, and Intr., ξ 24. —3. Idaeis:
from Mt. Ida in the Troad, the
original home of this cult, al-
though Pessinus in Phrygia (Ga-
latia), from which the meteorie
stone came to Rome, was far away
to the east.-—3. Magnae Matris:
the first Asiatic deity whose wor-
ship was introduced at Rome.
A Sibylline verse had been found
in 205, saying that aforeign enemy
(tle. Hannibal) could be driven
out of Italy and defeated, if the
lllater Idaea (Cybele) should be
brought to Rome from Pessinus
(Livy, 29, 10, 4—5). Ambassadors
were sent to Attalus, King of
Pergamon, who escorted them to
Pessinus and its celebrated temple.
The reception of the goddess at
Ostia, 204, by Scipio Nasica, as
the vir optimus in cwitate, was
a familiar story to every Roman
