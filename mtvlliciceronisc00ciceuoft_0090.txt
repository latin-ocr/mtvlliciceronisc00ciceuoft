At memoria minuitur.

M. TVLLI CICERONIS

Credo, nisi eam exer-

ceas, aut etiam si sis natura tardior. Themistocles omnium
civium perceperat nomina3 num igitur censetis eum, eum
aetate processisset, qui Aristides esset, Lysimachum salu·
5tare solitum? Equidem non modo eos novi qui sunt, sed
eor'um patres etiam et aVOS, nec sepulcra legens vereor,
quod aiunt, ne memoriam perdam; his enim ipsis legendis
in memoriam redeo mortuorum. Nec vero quemquam

same passage. The stulti adule-
scentuli probably urged the over-
turning of the aristocracy and
setting up of a king3 cf. on 1. 7.

21. At memoria minuitur: an
anticipated objection (cf. on 28, 1 3
33, 1 3 35, 1 3 47, 1) suggests the
whole subject of the decline of
mental power, and furnishes an
easy transition (21—26) to physical
decay, the second head in the
argument. — 1. Credo: accepts the
objection for those (and those
only) who are lacking in industry
or capacity.— 1. nisi. . . exerceas:
indefinite; cf. 36, 2: nisi . . . in-
stz'lles.—2. Themistocles: on the
form of the example, without in-
troductory particle or other cere-
mony· (since the illustration merely
explains a preceding general
truth), cf· 22, 53 33, 5; 37, 1;
63, 5.—4. qui Aristides esset: the
clause stands as (primary) object
to salutare.—5. Equidem: ‘For
myself, I.'—-5. eos: substituted
for nomina eorum. ——6. avos: cf.
lntr., ξ 33. —- 6. sepulcra: by
metonymy for the inscriptions.
Placed along the most travelled

roads, Roman timbs attracted
more attention to themselves and
to their epitaphs than do modern
cemeteries. The old custom re—
mains in Corsica, but not in Italy
or Sicily.—7. quod aiunt: com-
monly indicates a proverb, but
here merely a widespread supersti-
tion.—7. ne memoriam perdam:
aside from the superstition, those
who are absorbed in the past
become abstracted, and forgetful
of present affairs. Cato is not
speaking of historical memory or
reminiscence.—7. his . . .· le-
gendis: as a historian (lritn, ξ 35)
Cato had need of every available,
source of information as to the
past; cf. 38, 7: omnia antiqui-
tatis monumenta colligo. Among
his sources were inscriptions, still
largely sepulchral in his day.—
8. quemquam senem: ‘any one
who in his old age'; ef. 22, 2:
philosophi senes,- for quisqbcam
is regularly a substantive, with
which another substantive (here
senex) may stand in predicate
apposition. But quisquam is also
used even in Cicero (though
