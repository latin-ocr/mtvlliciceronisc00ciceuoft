Μ. TVLLI CICERONIS

6. Laelius. Atqui, Cato, gratissimum nobis, ut etiam
pro Scipione pollicear, feceris, si, quoniam speramus, volu-
mus quidem certe senes fieri, multo ante a te didicerimus
quibus facillime rationibus ingravescentem aetatem ferre

5 possimus.

Cafo. Faciam vero, Laeli, praesertim si utrique vestrum,

ut dicis, gratum futurum est.

Laelius. Volumus sane, nisi molestum est, Cato, tam-
quam longam aliquam viam. confeceris, quam nobis quoque
10 ingrediendum sit, istuc quo pervenisti, videre'quale sit.

III. 7. Cato. Faciam ut potero, Laeli.

“What (else) is Β, if A is not ?''
B in this case is attacking the
gods, as the giants did, while A
is resistance to Nature. To re-
sist Nature is to fight against the
gods, giant-fashion‚ with all its
impiety, its absurdity, its certainty
of defeat. For another interpre-
tation, cf. App.

6. Atqui: ‘Yes, but,' admitting
the truth of what Cato has said,
but inviting a fuller discussion. --
2. feceris . . . didicerimus: the

fut. perf. in both clauses is regu· ⁴

lar in the polite formula, gratum
(gratzlrsimum, etc.) feceris, si. . . .
—3. fieri: the fut. would be ex-
pected, if volumus had not been
inserted to correct speramus.—
4. rationibus: ‘ methods‚' ‘means'
—7. futurum est: related to erit
as ‘is to be' to ‘will be,' as present
anticipation to mere futurity.—
8. nisi molestum est: a formula
of politeness, instead of sodes, etc.
9. longam . . . viam: Cicero had

Saepe enim

in mind Plato, Rep. 328 E, though
the point with Socrates, is to in-
quire about the character of the
road leading to old age, while here
attention is drawn to the destina-
tion only.—9. quam . . . ingredi-
endum sit: archaic for the classim]
personal construction3 H. 621, 33
L. 2247? A. 2947 σς G. 427, n. ²3
R. 1398. One other example is
quoted from Cicero: obliviscendum

. . scelera (pro Scauro, 13 3 cf.
App.), in that case to avoid a string
of genitives. There is no reason
for suspecting a desire to use an
old-fashioned expression3 cf.Intr.‚ ι
ξ 21. That Cato himself avoided
the construction, is an unsafe in—
ference from the fact that it does
not occur in his extant works; for
Lucretius and Varro used it freely.
—— 10. istuc . . . videre quale sit:
a form of indirect question, very
common' in conversation.

7. enim: Cato's readiness to
begin a formal discussion of old
