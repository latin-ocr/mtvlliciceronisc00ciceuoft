culpa, nori in aetate.

M. TVLLI CICERONIS

Moderati enim et nec difficiles nec

15inhumani senes tolerabilem senectutem agunt; importuni-
tas autem et inhumanitas omni aetati molesta est.
8. Laelius. Est ut dicis, Cat0; sed fortasse dixerit quis-
piam tibi propter opes et copias et dignitatern tuam tolera-
biliorem senectutem videri, id autem non posse multis

contingere.

Cato. Est istud quidem, Laeli, aliquid, sed nequaquam

in isto sunt omnia. Vt Themistocles fertur Seriphio cui·

less frequently animus, ingenium,
natura, indoles, habitus, words
which required a definite context
to give them this meaning. This
sentence serves Cato as a text for
the whole of the discourse which
follows.·— 14. Moderati: those who
have shown temperance and self-
control in their pleasures will not
complain when the latter cease. —
14- et nec . . . nec: the sentence
is carefully articulated to show
that as the charge voluptatibus
carere is robbed of its force by
the example of the moderati, so
also is the sperni by the experi-
ence of men for whom natural
temperament (cf. difficiles) or
breeding (cf. inhumani) have
averted that danger. Cf. Horace,
Od. 1, 31, 17 ff.: et . . . et (ac?)
. . . nec . . . nec. —14. difficiles: of
men naturally hard to please or to
deal with.— 15. inhumani: of men
who through defect of training are
unfriendly‚ or unmannerly. With
these two adjectives correspond
the abstract nouns in ll. 15-16‚

while the thought in moderati is
not reiterated in the abstract form.
— 16. molesta est: ‘make trouble
for.'

8. Est ε referring, not to molesta
est, but to Cato's principal conten-

of politica] influence.—5. istud:
zd pers„ i.e. ‘what you say'3 in
English ‘in that’ does duty here
for both isttm' and in isto (6).
In the latter the neuter in an
oblique case is permitted owing to
the proximity of istud.— 5. qui-
dem: logically it should follow
aliquid, not istud3 but the word
here, as usually, when followed
up by an adversative clause,
shows its preference for the de-
monstrative,—the point, in other
words, where a gesture of .con-
cession would be made3 cf. on

an old one, and had suffered some
changes in retelling. Thus the
