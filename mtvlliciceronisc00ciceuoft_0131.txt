CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

me) admirari satis non possum vel hominis ipsius continen-

tiam vel temporum disciplinam. Curio ad focum sedenti ἔξω

magnum auri pondus Samnites cum attulissent, repudiati
sunt; non enim aurum habere praeclarum sibi videri dixit,

sed eis qui haberent aurum imperare.

Poteratne tantus

animus non efficere iucundam senectutem?

56. Sed venio ad agricolas, ne a me ipso recedam.

tious villa of the Elder Scipio at
Liternum (Ep. 86), where olive
trees planted by the hand of Scipio
still remained (Pliny, JV. H. 16,
234).—1o. Curio ad focum: the
story is abruptly introduced as
evidence of Curius's continentia.
— 11. auri pondus: the war was
over, and the gift was brought by
the Samnites, now his clients
(quondam hostium, tum iam clien-
stium suorum, dona repudiaverat,
Rep. 3, 40fin.).—13. Poteratne:
Cicero recognizes that the anecdote
about Curius has been a digression.

agricolas . . . ‚ recall the reader
first to the general subject of old

56. venio ad: cf. 32, 1 : redeo ad

me.— 1. In agris erant: ‘lived on
their farms'3 cf. 60, 5.—2‚ tum:

times.'—2. senes: cf. 19, 10. —
2. siquidem τ ‘since' ; assumed
cause (i.e. condition) and real

on 41, 8. —2. aranti: the four iu-

Cincinnatus, lay across the Tiber,
in the meadows (later Prata Quinc-
tia, from the gentile name of the
dictator or his ancestors) at the
foot of the Janiculum. But he had
a house in the city also3 cf. Livy,
3, 26, 8 ff.; Pliny, N. H. 18, 20.
—5. regnum: ‘kingly power.'—
5. occupatum interemit ι ‘ sur-
prised and slew‚' according to the
constant Latin habit of reducing
to a ptcp. (in the passive, if neces-
sary) what other languages ex-
press by coordinate verbs. The
story was frequently told by Cicero,
since it was a precedent in his favor
in the heated controversy as to
the constitutionality of his action
in executing fellow-conspirators of
