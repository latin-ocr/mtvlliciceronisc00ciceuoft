CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

having equidem in marg), Hm„ Bt.‚ Ml„ non omni H13 Msn. conj.
Etenim non. If the difficulty is not entirely removed by punctuation,
Non equidem (with the usual pointing) would be a more plausible read-
ing. From this a transposition in some Mss., a corruption into enim
in others, would readily account for what the codd. give us. For non
equidem, cf. ad Q. Fr. 2, 15, 4.

3. ego: the editions begin a new sentence here.

4. tuum, Scipio, tuumque, Laeli: suggested by Bt.‚ but not admitted
to his text3 adopted by Sch.‚ Ben., Anz, Korn„ Ws.; tu scipio tuque
Laeli LPBrA (C. in ras.), Bt.‚ P. Scipio (tu scipio v) tuque C. Laeli
VvBSM, Hm„ M1.; R has the same, omitting C„ E the same as BS
except for lelii5 H has tu Scipio et G. Laeli. Itis true, as Ml. says,
that the best MSS. often omit praenomina, but why should they appear
only here in the entire dialogue ? Cf. 35, 10.

9. domicilio: after this in P a rasura (ca. 9 letters).

12. tuerentur: an elaborate discussion of the meaning of this word,
and an interpretation of the whole passage, may be found in the Zeit-
schrift f. d. Gymnasz‘alwesen 33 (1879), 695 ff. The author, G.
Schneider, cites a number of other passages in Cicero which deal with
man's duty to cultivate the soil, and to maintain social order, ag. JV. D.

78. 3. quin ex: P ends with these words; from this point on its
readings have to be guessed from H and L2A2. Ramorino would rely
upon VM.

The impossibility of discovering a passage in Plato, which in the least
suggests the argument for immortality drawn from the unlimited capaci-
ties of the mind, has been passed over in silence by the commentators,
although they retain the words Haec Platonis fere, after recordari, 1. 20.
In Τ. l). 1, 66, Cicero quotes a parallel passage from his Consolatio,
which was based upon Crantor, who wrote the first commentaries on
Plato, and in his amplifications of Platonic teaching may possibly have
suggested this train of thought to Cicero. Schneider, op. cit. 699 ff.‚
doubts whether any thought of Plato*s underlies Cicero's argument at
this point, but shows that from the doctrine of ideas a proof of immor-

tality‚ more or less similar to this, could be constructed. Yet the μ

Platonic ideas do not seem to have been the starting-point for Cicero.
The difficulty is removed if Haec Platonis fere is considered an inter-
polation, as proposed by A. Otto, pp. 103—4. A marginal note calling
