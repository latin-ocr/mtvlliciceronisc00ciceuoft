M. TVLLI CICERONIS

a qua oriens uva se ostendit, quae et suco terrae et calore
solis augescens primo est peracerba gustatu, dein maturata
5dulcescit vestitaque pampinis nec modico tepore caret et

nimios solis defendit ardores.

Qua quid potest esse cum

fructu laetius, turn aspectu pulchrius? Cuius quidem non
utilitas me solum, ut ante dixi, sed etiam cultura et natura
ipsa delectat, adminiculorum ordines, capitum iugatio, re-
10 ligatio et propagatio vitium, sarmentorum ea, quam dixi,

inal meaning; ‘gem,' ‘jewel,' is
later. —5. nec . . . caret et . . . de-
fendit: this balanced mode of ex-
pression often occurs in Latin (true
to its love of symmetry) where
other languages would use ‘with-
out ' (or its equivalent) and a verbal
noun in place of the nec-clause3
cf. on 13, 12 (no such balance as
here).—7. fructu laetius: cf. 57,
3: usu uberius . . . specie orna-
tius,· the adj. has an active sense3
cf. Ennius (in Τ. D. 1, 69) :

Vite's laetzficae pampinis pubescere.

But laetus in this meaning was not
confined to literature3 laetas se-
getes etiam rustici dicunt (de
Oratore, 3, 155). Cf. 54, 7.—
8. utilitas: on Cato's entirely prac-
tical aims in agriculture, cf. Intr.,
ἐξ 13, 42, 43. A century after
Cato's time the cultivation of the
vine in Italy became one of the
chief sources of its wealth, and far
more profitable for the owner than
grain (cf. Columella, 3, 3, 2).—
8. ut ante dixi: viz. 51, 7.—
8. natura ipsa: cf. 52, 4: vim
zpsam. —9. adminiculorum ordi-

nes: ‘rows of props, or stakes'
(also ridicae, pedamenta), τῖε. not
connected to form an arbor (per-
gula, umbraculum). The modes
of supporting the vines were prob-
ably as different in different parts
of 1taly then as they are now.
Training them upon trimmed trees
(elm, poplar, ash, maple) Cicero
omits to mention, except as capi-
tum iugalia applies to this mode
as much as to any other.—
9· capitum iugatio: the capita are
not the tops of the stakes (for that
interpretation — otherwise a good
one-would exclude the method
just named), but the highest
branches of the vines (according
to Columella's definition, 3, 10, 1).
For iugalia cf. Varro, R. R. 1,
8, 1 : quae transversa iunguntur,
iuga [dicuntur] ,· ab eo quoque
vineae iugatae. The z'ugatio was
derecta, i.e. in a straight line only,
or more commonly compluviata
(Varro, l.c. 2), τῖε. crosswise as
well, forming an actual arbor or
pergula. — 9. religatio: the verbal
noun is found only here in extant
Latin.—1o. propagatio: cf. pro-
