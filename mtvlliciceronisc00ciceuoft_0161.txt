CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

facile retraxerit nec tamquam Peliam recoxerit.

Quo quidem me proficiscentem haud sane quis

Et si quis

deus mihi largiatur ut ex hac aetate repuerascam et in ιο
cunis vagiarn, valde recusem nec vero velim quasi decurso
spatio ad carceres a calce revocari.

gines; cf. Intr., ξ 35 ; the historian
hopes to meet those whom he has
celebrated—8. Quo: τῖε. ad quos,-
but place and persons are not dis-
tinctly separated in the thought;
cf. istinc, 47, 5.—8. haud: with
quis ,· not to be joined with re-
traxerit‚· cf. on 82, 15. —9. tam-
quam Peliam recoxerit: a pro-
verbial expression. The story of
Pelias was more dramatic than
that of Aeson‚—hence a familiar
allusion, regardless of the unhappy
consequences. Plautus also has
Pelias, instead of Aeson (in the
mouth of a cook), Pseudolus, 8693
cf. above, 50, 3. But proverbs
may conflict with the accepted
version of a tale. In one story
(Simonides, Pherecydes) it was
even Jason‚ not Aeson, who was
restored to youth. — 10. largiatur

. . recusem: less vivid future
condition, differing but slightly
from present unreal. — xo. re-
puerascam ε a rare word (but
found in a proverb in Plautus,
Mercator, 296); figuratively used
also by Cicero of Scipio and Lae-
lius on vacation,-—eosque incredi-
biliter repuerascere esse solitos,
cum rus ex urbe tamquam e vinclis
evolavzssent (de Oratore, 2, 22). ——

10. in cunis: the ancient cradle
had sometimes the form of a boat,
sometimes that of a shoe. The
slave who rocked it is spoken of
by Martial (11, 39, 1) as Cunarum
. . . motor . . . mearum.— 12. spa-
tio: cf. on 14,4.— 12. carceres: a
Roman race had one striking fea-
ture unknown to modern custom,
— the concealment of the waiting
chariots in a rowof stalls (carce-
res) under the seats at one end of
the circus. The signal being given
by the dropping of a napkin, slaves
instantly opened the doors of the
carceres, and all the horses ap-
peared at once. The actual start,
however, was made from a white
line drawn across the course at
the nearest turning-point (metae).
Cf. App.—12. a calce: the end
of the course was another white
line drawn across the course at a
point opposite the judges' stand,
which was on the same side as
the spectators. Hence calx was
proverbial for the end of anything3
here ‘from finish back to post.'
In Seneca's time creta, ‘chalk,’
was used instead of lime, but the
proverb, of course, remained un-
changed (Ep. 108, 32). For the
comparison of life with the raee-
