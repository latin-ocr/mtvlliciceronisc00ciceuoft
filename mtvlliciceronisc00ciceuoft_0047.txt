INTRODUCHON

VI. CIRCUMSTANCES IN wnrcfl THE DIALOGUE WAs
WRITTEN

45. It has been usually held that the Cato Maior was
written shortly after the assassination of Caesar,l perhaps
in the month of April. It is argued on the negative side
that allusions to the tyranny of Caesar would be made
here, as in some others of the philosophical works, if the
book had been written before the 15th March, 44 B.c. But
this is of small weight‚ for one might as well look for
plain allusions to the high-handed doings of Antony‚ if
the dialogue was written after the death of Caesar, and
then, because such expressions do not occur, proceed to
claim that Cicero must have written while Caesar was still
alive.

46. On the positive side, the later date has been argued
(1) from the fact that de Divinatione (except Bk. 1) was
composed after the death of Caesar ; hence the same must
be true of the Cato, because in the opening chapter of the
second book of de Divinatione the Cato Maior is spoken of
as a recent work; (2) from allusions to the present dialogue
in the letters of Cicero to Atticus‚2 where it is mentioned as
meeting the approval of Atticus, and likely to calm Cicero
himself on rereading it. The earliest of these letters -is
usually dated 11th May. Further support for the view
that the book was not written until after the assassination

1Among the editors who have dated the Cato Alaior in the spring of 44,
after the assassination of Caesar, are: Orelli, Baiter-Kayser, Lahmeyer, Som-
merbrodt, Meissner, Schneidewin, Reid, Shuckburgh-Egbert, Rockwood
(hesitatingly); also Kiihner in his German translation.

The earlier date, before the Ides of March, 44, ἱ5 preferred by Teuffel,
Maurer (in Fleck. Jahrb. 129 (1884), 386 fn), Kornstzer, Schiche, Stickney,
Bennett (who does not feel much certainty).

2 Cf. adAtt. 14, 21, 3, 11th May: 16, 3, 1, 16th or 17th July; 16, 11, 3,
5th November.
