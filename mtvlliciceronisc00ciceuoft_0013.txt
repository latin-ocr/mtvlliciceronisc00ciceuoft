PREFACE

Tm: text of this edition is based upon the readings of
the MSS. known to Halm and Muller, together with those

matter of keen regret that I have been unable to add any
collatioris of my own. All the more acknowledgment is
therefore due to Dr. P. C. Molhuysen‚ of the Leyden
University Library, for his kindness in furnishing those
readings of L which are marked with an asterisk.
Emendations have been admitted only where the text is
obviously corrupt. ’

Maior, to whom he was no mere mouthpiece for Cicero’s
opinions, but a vigorous personality pervading the entire
dialogue‚—a presence from which there is no escape.
