M. TVLLI CICERONIS

fuerat in arce, glorianti atque ita dicenti: ‘ Mea opera, Q.
Fabi, Tarentum recepisti‚’ ‘Certe‚' inquit ridens, ‘nam nisi

stu amisisses, numquam recepissem.'

Nec vero in armis

praestantior quam in toga 3 qui consul iterum Sp. Carvilio
collega quiescente C. Flaminio tribuno plebis, quoad potuit,
restitit agrum Picentem et Gallicum viritim contra senatus
auctoritatem dividenti; augurque cum esset, dicere ausus

cf. Index of Persons.—4. nisi tu:
cf. Livy, 27, 25, 5: adiecit tamen
[Fabius] fateri se opera Livi
[i.e. Macati] Tarentum receptum,
quod amici eius vulgo in senatu
iactassent, neque enim reczpiendum
fuisse, nisi amissum soret.—
6. qui: examples of F abius's con-
spicuous position in civil life (in
toga) follow in the form of simple
relative clauses, not (as often) of
characteristic clauses—6. consul
iterum: a mistake of Cicero's in
making the second consulship of
Fabius (228) coincide with the
tribuneship of Flaminius (232, as
is known from Polybius). — 7. qui-
escente: of political neutrality in
the heated strife of the classes. —
7. Flaminio: the lexFlaminia was
the first agrarian law to be passed,
and was later regarded by the men
of the Scipionic circle (including
Polybius, 2, 21, 8) as the begin-
ning of the downward course of the
Roman people. The lex Icilia,
456 B.c., and the Licinian laws of
367 had dealt with land questions,
but were not strictly agrarian
measures3 cf. Abbott‚ Roman Po-

-litical lnstitutions, ἐξ 29, 36.-

7. quoad potuit: because consuls
and senators were unable to resist
the will of the plebeian assembly
(concilium plebis,· cf. Abbott,
ἐξ 3¹5 ff., 3203 de Jnv. 2, 52).—
8. Gallicum: the Gallie Senones
had been expelled from their coun-
try, along the Adriatic between
Ancona and Ariminum, more than
fifty years before, and colonies
established. It was now a ques-
tion of lands not previously as-
signed.—8. viritim: tle. not to
new colonies‚ but to individuals..
—8. contra: cf. de Inv. l.c.,· invito
senatu et omnino contra volun-
tatem omnium optimatium per
seditionem ad populum legem agra-
riam serebat.—9. dividenti: co-
native ; the imperf. indic. of
attempted action replaced by the
pres. ptcp.; cf. 54, 5.——-9. augur:
as such he might have been con-
servative, but in his radica] views
of augury he almost rivals Flami-
nius, whose neglect of omens was
scandalous. Fabius was said to
have been augur for the incredible
number of sixty-two or sixty-three
