INTRODUCPION

has met the inereasing approval of Atticus, and given him
some consolation. The first letter (ξ 3) says: Legendns
mihi saepius est ‘Cato maz'or' ad te missus. Amariorem
enim me senectus facit. stomachor omnia. From the con-
text the cause of his vexation is clear. His high hopes of
a restored republic have been dashed. The tyranny of
Caesar has merely descended to Antony, and the assassi-
nation, which at first brought such joy to the hearts of
Cicero and all the optimates, is now seen to have had no
other effect than to place equally unlimited power in less
competent hands. This sudden revulsion of feeling makes
Cicero eager to recall the mood of philosophie calm in
which he had reeently written on old age. But such a
wish presupposes an interval, during which, with the pass-

age was to be made happy have grown rusty in memory.
It would be absurd to say legendus milei saepius of a book
written within six weeks‚ the ink scarcely dry. Evidently
the Cato must precede the death of Caesar.

(3) As for the serene, if not exactly happy, mood in
which the whole dialogue is written, it is quite unneeessary
to assume as its cause the joy felt by Cicero when the
liberatores had accomplished their work, and rid the state
of Caesar. That joy was too sudden and unrestrained, not
to say far too short-lived, to result in philosophie calm.
The bitterest disappointment at once replaced the exulta-
tion of the moment. There is no time after the assassi-
nation when we ean imagine Cicero sitting down in so
tranquil a frame of mind. In the peaeeful temper of the
Cato one must feel that something of resignation is present.
He tells us, in fact, in the second book of the de Divina-
tione1 that Plato and philosophy have taught him to see in
tyranny only one of the forms of government through
