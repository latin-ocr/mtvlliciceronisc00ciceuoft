INTRODUCI'ION

the same spirit, and with the same covert purpose, he
labored and wroteon law and agriculture, history, medi—
cine, and rhetoric, yet secretly drawing not a little of his

wisdom from the Greek sources he pretended to despise.1 ’

11. That he read Greek literature in his old age2 was
not a sign of final submission to the irresistible Greek cul-
ture, but rather of unabated ardor in the service of a cause
so far from lost that its grizzled champion could still plan
a wholesale ‘spoiling of the Egyptians.' His first acquaint-
ance with the language of Greece must have been made in
earlier years;3 whether in Sardinia in his quaestorship,
under the tutelage of Ennius, as has been'stated,4 or at
Rome, will remain uncertain.

12. In deed as in word the best exponent since Appius
Claudius of the old patriarchal idea, Cato shows his one
attractive side in his family life, as the devoted father and
the good husband, — a higher title to farne, to quote him-
self, than to be a great senator.5 Singularly gentle in
his affection for his baby boy, he lavished time and atten-
tion upon the education of the son6 whose marriage was
to ally the plebeian leader with the great Aemilius Paulus,

⁸ In 191, Plutarch thinks he might have addressed the Athenians without
an interpreter, had he chosen to depart from custom (Plut.‚ Calo, 12). There
is no reason to believe that Cato first learned Greek in his old age. However
indifferent to literature in its highest forms, the mind of Cato was too active
to rest content with any door closed. Cf. Rieci, Catone nell' opposizione alla
cultura greca e ai grecheggianli‚ Palermo, 189 5; Cortese, De M. Porci Catonis
