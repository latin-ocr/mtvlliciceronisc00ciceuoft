M. TVLLI CICERONIS

non domestica solum, sed etiam externa [bella]. Cuius
10 sermone ita cupide fruebar, quasi iam tum divinarem, id
quod evenit, illo exstincto fore unde discerem neminem.
V. 13. Quorsum igitur haec tarn multa de Maximo?
Quia profecto videtis nefas esse dictu miseram fuisse talem
senectutem. Nec tamen omnes possunt esse Scipiones aut
Maximi, ut urbium expugnationes, ut pedestres navalesve

5 pugnas, ut bella a se gesta, ut triumphos recordentur. Est
etiam quiete et pure atque eleganter actae aetatis placida

broadest sense. — 8. memoria: abl.
of means, of the power by which
the mind retain53 never in me-
moria tenere, as the place or seat
of such power. —9. domestica . . .
. externa: subst.‚ of history in gen-
eral; cf. 20. 3. For the text, cf.
App.—1o. ita: correlative with
quasi.-—11. unde: personal, i.e.
a quo, a use in which unde is
more frequently found than any of
the other relative and demonstra-
tive adverbs; cf. H. 510, 11; L.
1793; G. 611, R. 1.

13. haec tam multa: no verb
need be supplied, though ltaec
multa is acc., as the object to
which thought is directed—2. pro-
fecto videtis z instead of answering‚
‘ Because I wished to prove that‚'
Cato says, by an easy antici ation,
‘ Beoeuse you surely see tha? . . .'
-2. fuisse z depending upon
dictu, for this supine is sometimes
(rarely) followed by a subordinate
clause, i.e. a quotation or indirect
question; cf. L. 2275. ——3. Scipi-
ones: ‘such men as Scipio' (sug-

gested by the mention of F abius's
last years) 3 cf. 15, 12. On Cato's
real attitude towards Africanus,
cf. Intr.‚§ 18. —4. expugnationes:
Cato had himself oeptured many
cities in Spain; cf. Intr.‚ ξ 26.÷-
4. pedestres: in contrast with na·
vales, not with an unexproesed
equestres. — 6. pure atque elegan-
ter: form a pair joined by et to
quiete3 cf. et nec . . . nec, 7, 14.
That pure should be thus united
to eleganter is not without a
reason. In Cato's time elegans
and eleganter had a dispataging
sense,—were in fact terms of
reproach for fastidious extrava-
gance and undue luxury. By
Cicero's time the bad meaning had
almost disappeared‚ but the words
were guardedly used. So here,
lest eleganter should be taken in
the worse sense, it is joined with
pure, which with its idea of mbml
cleanness‚ fixes the wavering mm-
ing of eleganter. Together they
denote a life with moral fibte be-
neath the outward graces. Good
