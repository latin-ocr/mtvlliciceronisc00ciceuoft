senem audivi oblitum quo loco thesaurum obruisset; omnia
quae curant meminerunt, vadimonia constituta, quis sibi, 10

cui ipsi debeant.

22. Quid iuris consulti? quid pontifices? quid augures?
quid philosophi senes? quarn multa meminerunt! Manent

n. 23 Krebs, op. cit. 2, p. 418.
—9. thesaurum: to the ancient
practice of burying money (usu-
ally under the house) we owe
most of our coin collections. The
Roman law had to concern itself
with treasure trove, which it de-
fined as vetus quaedam depositio
pecuniae, cuius non exstat memo-
ria, ut iam dominum non habeat
(Paulus, ng. 41, 1, 31, 1). A
hoard often figured in the plots of
comedies, as in Plautus's Aulula-
ria and T rinummus. — 10. vadi-
monia constituta : ⁴ engagements in
court'3 vadimonium often means
bail, the amount fixed (consti-
tutum) by the praetor, but the word
was also used where no bail or
forfeit was exacted of the defend-
ant, or even an oath‚ but only a
simple promise to appear again.
The whole matter was regulated
by the edict of the praetor3 cf.
Gaius, 4, 184-5.

22. Quid . . . quid: these are
not really questions (with agunt or

faciunt) ς for in rhetorical pas-
sages quid? becomes a mere for-
mula of transition to a new head,
or accompanies the members of a
series (‘ and then, and . . . too ') 3
cf. 26, 93 83, 1.—1. iuris consulti:
one of the subjects of meminerunt,
along with pontzfices, augures, plu·-
losoplti, to each of which senes is
in predicate apposition3 iuris con-
sulti were jurists, not lawyers or
advocates, such as Cicero and Hor-
tensius, who often disclaimed any
thorough knowledge of the law,
and referred to a jurist (eg. Ser-
vius Sulpicius) on knotty points.
The opinions of the iuris consulti
gradually acquired the force of law
(at least in the case of those to
whom the emperors gave the ius
respondendi) 3 cf. 27, 12. —1. pon-
tifices . . -. augures: memory would
be required by them, in order to
retain all the details of ceremonial
law and practice or the intricate
rules ofaugury. - 2. Manent: note ⁴
order and asyndeton3 ‘Old men
do retain.'—3. studium et indu-
stria: corresponding inversely to
the two points made in 21, viz.
‘ practice ' (nisi eam exerceas, 1. 1),
and ·' interest' (omnia quae curant,
