PREFACE

duction was originally continued to the present time, but

“ the later and larger portion has been suppressed in the

interest of brevity.

It is hoped that the time-honored practice of inserting
modern Latin verses needs no justification, even though
their august author, long preeminent among senes, has
just passed into history. The thanks which would have
been here returned to Pope Leo himself for gracious
permission to reprint his hexameters‚ must now be paid
to Mgr. Rinaldo Angeli, his secretary‚ and to Reverend
Father John Ρ. Farrelly‚ of the American College in
Rome, for ready help in securing the desired permission;
also to the American Ecclesiastz‘cal Remu), which has in
the meantime acquired the copyright in this country.

What friendly obligations have been imposed by the
great kindness of the general editors, as also of Professors
Frank F. Abbott, of the University of Chicago, Hanns
Oertel, of Yale, John K. Lord and R. W. Husband, of
Dartmouth College, it would be difficult to say in brief, —
except that by a critical reading of the proofs they have
shown a practical interest in the book in its unfinished
state, and have contributed most generously of their
scholarship to its final form.

In accordance with the plan of the series, references
have been given to most of the grammars now in general
use, and these are distinguished by initials. To Madvig
and Roby also an occasional reference will be found.
