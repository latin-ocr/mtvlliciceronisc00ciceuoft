CATO MAIOR DE SENECI'VTE

Os witty sayings he also made a collection,¹ to which'the
name Ἀποφθένγματα was given by others. This was a
diversion of his old age. Cato's own bons mots were con-
stantly quoted. A selection of them is given by Plutarch
in his Lffe (ff Cato (8—9). Cicero was fond of repeating
the witticisms of the old censor. As an example may

be given the story of Cato and the man who was carry- ’

ing a chest. ‘Cave,' said the man, aster Cato had been
struck. The censor only asked, ‘qum quid aliud fers
nisi arcam ? ' ²

41. But the one extant work of Cato is his well-known
de Agri Cultura, or de Re Rustica, in 162 brief chapters.
No one had yet written upon this subject for Roman
readers. A long list of Greek writers, however, could
furnish him with material, if he were disposed to borrow.
Whether he had heard of the Carthaginian Magoss and his
twenty—eight books4 on agriculture is more than doubtful,
though that work was translated into Latin by order of the
senate a few years after Cato’s death,5 and in Cicero’s time
was accounted the standard work on farming.

42. Cato’s own work on agriculture is at the farthest
remove from a systematic treatise. A certain effort at
arrangement may be traced through a considerable portion,
but the remainder has all the flavor of an old-time book of
receipts, with the same lack of logical sequence. Cooking

the critics are hopelessly divided ; cf. Teuffel, 121, 33 Jordan, p. ciii3 Ger-
lach, p. 37.

¹ Off. ι, 104; Plut.‚ Cato, 2 fin. Julius Caesar made a similar collection,
to which Cicero (ad Fam. 9, 16, 4) applies the same Greek title. Jordan,
p. 83, has but two fragments. ‘² Cf. de Orat. 2, 279.

⁸ Columella, the Spanish writer on agriculture in the time of Nero, speaks
of Mago as the father os the art, 1, 1, 13.

4 Col. ib.; Varro, R. R. 1, 1, 10; Isid.‚ Orrgg. 17, 1, 1.

⁵ It was Carthagine capta, according to Plin.‚ N. H. 18, 22: Columella
gives no date.
