INTRODUCTION ”

War had forbidden various forms of extravagance among
women. The law was repealed, however, in the face of
Cato’s violent opposition.l Once in Spain, his task was
practically the recovery of the entire province,2 beginning
with his first encounter with the rebels but a short distance
south of the Pyrenees. In this battle he showed great
courage and generalship, especially in attacking the enemy
from the rear, after marching past in the night to a position
in which his men might be thrown entirely upon their own
,resourcesss For the same reason he had sent his ships
back to Massilia.4 He later ordered all the cities in the
region of the Ebro to throw down their walls on the same
day.5 Immense sums in money and bullion were carried
through the streets of Rome when Cato celebrated his
triumph⁶ (194). The memory of his triumphis preserved
not only in the historians and other writers, but also in
inscriptions.⁷

27. Not satisfied with these laureis, Cato offered his
services for the war against Antiochus in 191, accepting
without a murmur the commission- of a simple tribune of
the soldiers⁸ under the consul Manius Acilius Glabrio.
Here also he had the companionship of his old friend and
recent cosseague, L. Valerius Flaccus, in a similar capacity.9
