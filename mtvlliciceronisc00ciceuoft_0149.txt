CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[δ 71-72

quasi terram videre videar aliquandoque in portum ex
longa navigatione esse venturus.

XX. 72. Senectutis autern nullus est certus terminus,
recteque in ea vivitur quoad munus offici exsequi et tueri
possis ³⁸⁵ * mortemque contemnere; ex quo fit ut animo-

sior etiam senectus sit quam adulescentia et fortior.

Hoc

illud est quod Pisistrato tyranno a Solone responsum est, 5
cum illi quaerenti qua tandem re fretus sibi tam audaciter
obsisteret, respondisse dicitur: ‘Senectute' Sed vivendi

13. in portum: a reminiscence of
T. D. 1, 118 : portum potius para-
tum nobzls· et perfugium putemus.
Quo utinam velis passis pervehi
liceat! Cf. Epictetus, 4, 10: ⁶ death
is the harbour for all; this is the
place of refuge ' (Long).

⁷2. terminus: the familiar fig-
ure of the boundary-stone; cf.
Seneca, l.c. on 69, 6 ς pro Rabi-
rio perd. 29: vitae termini. -
2. recte: not in a moral sense,
nor yet of wisdom or prudence (as
in Horace's Rectius vives, Ode 2,
10, 1); the idea is of a normal
existence for the old man, of that
which is in the order of nature;
recteque . . . possis is interpreted by
Sed vivendi est finis optimus . . .
11. 7—8 (note the resumptive Sed),
in which the same thought is re-
cast, and what was vaguely ex-
pressed in recte is made definite
in finis optimus. To understand
vtw'tur of holding on to life, in-
stead of laying down its burdens
voluntarily, conflicts with the pro-
hibition of suicide below, 73, 1-4.
—2. munus offici: cf. on 29, 2. —

2. tueri: i.e. sustinere ,· cf. T. D.
5, 113: geometriae munus tueba-
tur,· cf. 77, 7—8‚ 12.—3. possis:
the indes. second person3 cf. 9,
3; cf. 25, 9-10, where the indef.
third person is used, and hence the
indic. For the text, cf. App.—
3. animosior: cf. Seneca, l.c. on
71, 1·—4· Hoc illud est: ‘this is
the meaning of.' The first person
demonstrative lzoc merely brings
the old story (3d pers, or remote,
demonstrative illud) into connec-
tion with the speaker's argument,
with the necessary inference that
an interpretation is intended. Cf.
Aeneid, 7, 255 :

Hunc illum fatis externa ab sede
profectum
Portendi generum, etc.

ib. 2723 Dz'v. 1, 122.—6. audaci-
ter : the unusual form for audacter ;
not an archaism‚ however (Intr.,
§21, n. 5), for no certain instances
of its use are known before the
age of Cicero. The eruditi usually
said audacter3 cf. Neue, 2⁸, 684-
685.-—7. . Sed: ‘But, as I was
