are not to accept a few stray survivals from older usage as
proof of a deliberate attempt to imitate the archaic style of
Cato. Abundant materials existed for such an imitation,
and Cicero was entirely competent, had he chosen‚ to
amuse the learned,—a Varro, for example,—by a mere
display of ingenuity in reviving an obsolete style. It
would have been difficult, however, to forget himself, and
make his Cato speak in short, oracular sentences, after the
dry and juiceless manner of the de Re Rustica. Readers
accustomed to the rounded periods of a highly finished
style, would have turned away from an ill-considered and
wholly useless attempt to imitate the crude beginnings of
Latin prose. The writer had no choice but to employ his
own style throughout, knowing that not even the most
pedantic would find fault because this Cato speaks with
the tongue of Cicero.1

IV. THE CAREER OF CATo

22. Marcus Porcius Cato was born, according to the
most reliable accounts, in 234 B.c.‚2 at the Latin town of

participles as passives in §§ 4, 74, 79, a thing common enough in Cicero3
(2) the occurrence of quasi = quem ad modum in § 7¹3 (3) of audaciter =
audacter in ἓ 723 (4) of tuerentur for intuerentur [as explained by some]·in
ᾗ 77; (5) of neutiquam in §423 (6) of the nominative of the gerund govern-
ing an accusative case in ἓ 6.” Cf. Sommerbrodt on 71, Meissner, p. 3. In
38, 2, mancipasa (for which most editors read emancipata) must be a remi-
niscence of the older legal terminology of Cato's time. Cf. also on 71, 9.

¹ The most striking example of the ideal Cato speaking in language which
the real Cato could only have used in a disparaging sense is found in eleganter,
13, 6, in the phrase pure atque eleganter actae aetatis. For Cato himself, in
his Carmen de Moribus, puts the word elegans on the same level with sumptu-
osus, cupidus, and vitiosus. This citation alone, without the comments of
Gellius (11, 2, 3), would show that the word was, a term of reproach.

² The date of his death is fixed with precision by Cicero, Brutus, 61 (eighty-
six years before the consulship of Cicero); also by Vell. Patere. 1, 13 (three
years before the destruction of Carthage) and Plin.‚ JV. H. 29, 15 (DC V anno
