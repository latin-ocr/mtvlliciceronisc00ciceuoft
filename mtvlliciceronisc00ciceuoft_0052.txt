CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

older than the ninth century. Within a generation several
neglected Mss. have been brought to notice, with the
result that the text as given by the older editors has suf-
fered not a few changes.

For many years the standard edition was that of Halm
(Hm.)‚ in vol. 4 of the Orelli-Baiter-Halm Cicero, Ziirich,
1861.- The text was derived from the following Mss. ε -

Ρ = Parisinus, 6332, tenth century, Hm, or ninth, Dahl. This ends in
ξ 78, but is much the most important of Halm's Mss.‚ containing
also the T usculan Disputatzbns, and is the only profane MS. of im-
portance which divides the text into verses, as in the scriptures.

B = Benedictoburanus, in Munich (4611), twelfth century.

E = Erfurtensis, in Berlin, Royal Library (252), twelfth century.

I = Indersdorfiensis, Munich (7809), thirteenth century.

R = Rhenaugiensis, 127, Ziirich, twelfth century, Hm. (fifteenth‚ Bt„
eleventh, Chatelain).

S z Salisburgensis, Munich (15‚964), eleventh century.

N = a fragment at Berne, ἐξ 80-85 only, thirteenth century.

Halm also gave the readings of a few other Mss. in Ger-
man libraries. ·

50. The recension of Baiter(Bt.), in vol. 7 of Baiter and
Kayser’s Cicero, Leipzig, 1864, took advantage of the re-
cent collation by Mommsen (1863) of —

L = Leidensis (Voss. F. 12), Leyden‚ tenth century, a MS. now oon-
sidered to be of equal importance with P, though previously it had
been all but unknown. Bt. also brought another Ms. into notice,

Q :vilgsse-tnaugienffls’ 126, Ziirich, twelfth century.

In the Teubner text-edition of Cicero, pt. 4, vol. 3,
Leipzig, 1879, a still higher value was placed upon L by
C. F. W. Muller (ML), who ranks P as inferior in authority
to L, a view held by Sommerbrodt also (v. below), and by
others. This deference paid to L in the years following

its discovery has somewhat lessened since other MSS.—
