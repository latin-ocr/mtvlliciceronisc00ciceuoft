CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[δ 53-54

aliorum amputatio, aliorum inmissio. Quid ego irrigationes,
quid fossiones agri repastinationesque proferam, quibus fit

multo terra fecundior ?

54. Quid de utilitate loquar stercorandi ?—dixi in eo
libro quem de rebus rusticis scripsi—de qua doctus Hesio-
dus ne verbum quidem fecit, cum de cultura agri scriberet.
At Homerus, qui multis, ut mihi videtur, ante saeculis fuit,
Laertam lenientem desiderium quod capiebat e filio, colen· 5

tem agrum et eum stercorantem facit.

pagz'nes‚ 52, 8 ; if used in the strict'
sense we have ‘layering' in con-
trast with ‘binding up,' ‘tying’
(religatio); if in a more general
sense, of any branch, the meaning
(cf. Gellius, 10, 15, 13) differs but
little from inmissio. —11. inmis-
sio: the branch is given free rein,
as it were, and allowed to bear.
—-11. Quid . . . proferam: cf.
on 52, 1.—11. irrigationes: the
art was learned by the Romans
from its past-masters, the Etrus-
cans. — 12. repastinationes: pas-
tinum, a two-pronged implement
(ferramentum bifurcum, Colu-
mella, 3, 18, 1), has given its name
to the process.

54. Quid . . . loquar: cf. on
52, 1.—1. stercorandi: the dis-
coverer of this practice in Italy was
supposed by the rustics to be a
god, and naively named stercutus,
Stercutius, Sterculus, Sterculinius
(cf. Pliny, N. H. 17, 503 Isidore,
Orzjgg. 17, 1, 33 2, 33 cf. App.). —-
1. in eo libro: cf. Intr.‚ ἐξ 41 ff.;
R. R. 29, 36, and many other
passages. The sum of Cato's

wisdom on the subject he put in
this oracular form (61, 1), ‘ Quid
est agrum bene colere ,θ’ Bene
arare. ⁴ Quid secundum ,θ’ Arare.
⁶ Quid tertium ,θ’ Stercorare.—
2. de rebus rusticis: instead of
the exact title de Agri Cultura.
The book was also cited as de
Re Rustica, and still is more
generally known under that name.
Varro's work bore the title Rerum
Rusticarum Libri. — 2. doctus:
without ille vir, because a stand-
ing epithet, like Laelius Sapiens.
—3· de cultura agri: z‘.e. in his
Works and Days.—4. Homerus:
Od. 24, 226-7. A better Homeric
example would have been ib. 17,
²97-93 cf. below, l. 6. —4. saecu-
lis: in same meaning as in 24, 103
25, 5.—5. lenientem: cf. on 11,
9. —6. stercorantem: this is not
expressly stated by Homer, but
inferred from λιστρεύοντα, ⁴ dig-
ging about) Pliny so understood
it, for in JV. Η. 17, 50, Laertes is
a regius senex agrum ita laetificans
suis manibus.—6. facit: cf. on
3, 6; ποιέω (cf. ποιητής) was used
