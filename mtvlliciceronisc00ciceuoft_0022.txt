CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

from the hills with the ardor of a new-found mission‚——the
defence of ancient custom‚ and determined opposition to all
who were ready to sacrifice everything old and established
in the interests of expansion. Even those who had most
conspicuously served the state in the past found in Cato
no respecter of personS, if their present conduct did not in

hardy, if unlovely‚ child of his most vigorous years. In
