M. TVLLI CICERONIS

pubescens includitur; ex quibus cum emersit, fundit frugem

munitur vallo aristarum.

52. Quid ego vitium ortus, satus, incrementa comme-

morem ?

Satiari delectatione non possum, ut meae se-
nectutis requietem oblectamentumque noscatis.

Omitto

enim vim ipsam omnium, quae generantur e terra; quae

frugum aut stirpium minutissimis seminibus tantos truncos

ramosque procreet.

Cato has passed insensibly to the
ear. — 14. pubescens: i.e. in its
first maturity ς cf. adulescit, 1. 13. —
14. fundit frugem: ‘brings forth
the grain.'—- 15. spici: for the
usual fem. spica Cicero here uses
spiens or spicum. — 15. ordine:
‘regularityff — 16. munitur: the
change of subject is natural enough
in a long sentence in conversation.
For the figure, cf. on 49, 1.

52. Quid . . . commemorem? on
the praeteritzb, cf. on 24, 1 3 cf. 54,
1; 5513 57‚1;61‚9-—1·egoz
cf. on ut . . . noscatis, 1. 2.—
1. ortus, satus, incrementa: singul
lar in English in each case. — 2. ut
. . . noscatis: not the purpose of
satiari . . . non possum, but
giving the motive which prompts
Cato to speak of his delight in the
culture of the vine (cf. on 56,
14; cf. 59, 5) —a fact with which
Scipio and Laelius were well
acquainted (hence ego ofl. 1).—
3. Omitto: cf. Quid, above, l. 1.—
4. vim ipsam: ‘native force' or

Malleoli, plantae, sar-menta, vivira-

‘energy.'-4. quae (exfici): the
antecedent is rather terra (in spite
of its position in a parenthesis)
than vim ipsam, with which the
verb procreet (l. 7) is less suitable
than with terra. — 5. acini vinaceo ε
any berry growing in a cluster was
called acinus (or acinum), hence
the grape in particular, as here,
while the seed of the grape was
vinaceum (or vinaceus); cf. Co-

lumella, 11, 2, 69: vinacea, quae ,

acinis celantur. — 7. meoli:
‘mallets,' young shoots cut from
a last year's branch, with a piece
of the latter forming the head of
the hammer (Columella, 3, 6, 3)’.
the handle was called sagitta (id.
3, 10, 22). This method had been
abandoned by the writers on vine-
culture before the time of Cicero,
in favor of simple exsection. The
name, however, remained, while
the thing had become identical
with the sarmentum (id. 3, 17, 4;
cf. sarmentis· below, 1. 13). The

nursery os young vines was called
