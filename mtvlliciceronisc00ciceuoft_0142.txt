Μ. TVLLI CICERONIS

65. At sunt morosi et anxii et iracundi et difficiles senes.
Si quaerimus, etiam avari3 sed haec morum vitia sunt, non

senectutis,

Ac morositas tamen et ea vitia quae dixi, ha-

bent aliquid excusationis non illius quidem iustae, sed quae
5 probari posse videatur; contemni se putant, despici, inludi;
praeterea in fragili corpore odiosa omnis offensio est.
Quae tamen omnia dulciora fiunt et moribus bonis et arti·
bus, idque curn in vita, tum in scaena intellegi potest ex

Roman play was not originally di-
vided by pauses into distinct acts.
An artificial division was intro-
duced by the grammarians. The
audience in most cases recognized
a succession of scenes only, not
grouped into acts. Cicero's ex-
pression here, accordingly, means
something less definite than its
translation in English ς cf. on 5, 6.

65. At sunt: the remainder of
Cato's answer to the third charge
considers the objection that many
men have faults which lose them the
respect of which he has been speak-
ing. Cato concedes a still worse
fault (avaritia), by way of proving
that age itself is not responsible for
any of them—1. morosi: corre-
sponds to that use of mos in which
the word was applied to the indi-
vidualitiae, the peculiar ways,
whims, and oeprices of men; cf.

morositas below, 1. 3. —-1. diffi-

ciles: cf. on 7, 14.—2. quaerimus:
not ‘look for them' (they are not
hard to find), but in a general
sense of looking more closely into
the subject.—2. morum: cf. on

7, 13 (in moribus est culpa, non in
aetate). -3. habent: ‘admit of'3
a recognized use of this νεὼς
things which admit ot' compar-ison

· are said habere comparationem,·

cf. T. l). 5, 38fin.; cf. below, 67,
5, where ‘admit of' is ‘be subject
to,' as an estate subject to the civil
law was said habere ius civile; cf.
pro Flacco, 80 3 N iigelsbach‚ op. cit.
p. 439. —4. non illius quidem . . .
sed: in this form of concession
Cicero is very fond of tue un-
necessary, but not altogether idle,
ille before quidem. 1f a lst or 2d
person is required, lu‘c or iste, or
a personal pronoun (or equidem),
takes the place of ille‚· cf. on 8, 53
H. 507, 53 L. 2361; G. 307, R.
4. -— 5. probari: not implying
complete approval, but an excuse
which will pass. —5. contemni . . . ,
despici, inludi: a climax, for de-
spicere is more serious than con—
temnere (cf. Nonius, 436, 25 M.);
the latter does not always suggest
a conscious slight. — 7. bonis z
the order throws it with artibus
not less than with moribus. —
