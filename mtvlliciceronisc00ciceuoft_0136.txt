ιο set, et ceteris in rebus comem erga Lysandrum atque hu-
manum fuisse et ei quendam consaeptum agrum diligenter

consitum ostendisse.

Cum autem admiraretur Lysander

et proceritates arborum et derectos in quincuncem ordines
et humum subactam atque puram et suavitatem odorum,
15 qui adflarentur ex floribus, tum eum dixisse mirari se non
modo diligentiam, sed etiam sollertiam eius a quo essent
illa dimensa atque discripta; et Cyrum respondisse: ‘ Atqui
ego ista sum omnia dimensus; mei sunt ordines, mea di-
scriptio, multae etiam istarum arborum mea manu sunt

Turn Lysandrum intuentem purpuram eius et nito-

rem corporis ornatumque Persicum multo auro multisque

9. sardis: ace. of the place to
which, for in all such cases the
Latin has in mind the journey
to the place, rather than the
meeting of the persons at the
place.—9. sociis: meaning Sparta
and the other cities allied against
Athens in the Peloponnesian War.
From Cyrus he received much
more than he gave in the dona
mentioned here—10. et ceteris

. et: cf. 4. 2: cum ceterarum
rerum . . . tum‚· cf. 60, 2.—
11. consaeptum agrum: παράδει-
σος is thus translated‚—such as
Xenophon mentions also in the
Anabasis (1, 2, 73 2, 4, 14), though
the anecdote relates to the garden
proper, and not to the ganne-pre-
serve, which usually formed the
chief feature of a παράδεισος. But
cf. Oecon. 4„ 13: κῆποι . . . οἱ παρά-
δεισοι καλούμενοι, terh—13. in
quincuncem: i.e. in diagonal rows.
The ‘name was taken from the 1⁰2,

which in the older nomtion stood

sor quincunx, ἦ (later = = -).
On dice, the same sign stood for
5, since in the duodecima] system
ᾖ, may be treated as 5 units. A
grove of trees thus planted was
itself called quincunx (cf. Quint.
8, 3, 9: Quid illo quincunce specio-
sius . . . ?).—14. subactam: cf.
on 51, 9.—14. puram: ‘well-
kept,' ‘well-cleared'3 of the same
origin with puto, ·are‚ ‘to clean}
‘to prune' (out of which all the -
more familiar meanings are de-
rived).—17. dimensa: passive3
cf. on 4, 12.—x7. discripta:
discn’bo implies separation, and
means ‘to allot‚' ‘apportiom' ‘dis-
tribute'3 describo is ‘to design,'
‘plot‚' ‘chart'3 ef. 49, 8. If the
distribution of the trees had been
indicated on a sketch-plan, either
word could have been used.—
18. ista . . . omnia: ‘all that you
see.'-21. ornatumque Pmimmz
