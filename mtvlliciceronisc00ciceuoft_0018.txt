CATO MAIOR DE SENECrVTE

>non me loqui existimem. In these words of his Laelius
(ἕ 4), Cicero gives us at the same time the special reasons
for the choice of Cato as the chief speaker, the general
method of adding weight to one's opinions by putting
them in the mouth of some great man of a former age,
and the effect produced even upon the writer himself.

3. To go back to Cato’s time was deliberately to exclude
from mention many prominent men who had borne age
well in the long interval of more than a century between
the assumed time of the dialogue, the year 150 B.c.,¹ and
the date of writing.2 For this limitation‚ however, ample
compensation was found in the weight of Cato’s personal-
ity‚ as the beau-ideal of an active, useful, and happy old
age. Thus, by the most eminent example that could be
cited, the practical Roman mind would be moved far more
deeply than by the cleverest philosophica] arguments.
Not that Greek writers had failed to observe the advan-
tages of a method which sugared latter-day preaching with
the sweets of hero-worship. Cyrus ille a Xenophonte non
ad historiae fidem scriptus, sed ad effigiem iusti imperi
is Cicero's own comment3 on Xenophon’s method in the
Cyropaedz‘a. In other words, the real Cyrus is lost in the
writer's ideal of the just ruler. Plato’s dialogues⁴ had
made the ideal Socrates a familiar figure to cultivated
Roman readers. But an essential difference separates the

’- Platonic method from that of Cicero. For in Plato the

opinions of one philosopher are placed in the mouth of

mini Catonem, anno ante quam est mortuus, mecum et cum Scipione disse-
rere. . . . Cato died in 1493 cf. 1ntr., ξ 33.

in the state, quod erant inferiores quam illorum aetas qui loquebantur (ad Q.
