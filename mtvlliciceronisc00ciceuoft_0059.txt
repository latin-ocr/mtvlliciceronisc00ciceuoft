NOMENCLATOR SEN VM

greatest scholar of the day, and its most distinguished example of
a happy and industrious old age.

Terentia, the wife of Cicero, whom he divorced in 46, reached the great
age of 103 (Plin., N. H. 7, 158).

M. Tullius Tiro, the freedman and secretary of Cicero, lived to be one
hundred, and died 4 B.c.

Orbilius Pupillus (ca. 114—ca. 17) the stern schoolmaster of Horace,
plagosus Orbilius, came to Rome at the age of fifty in the consul-
ship of Cicero (63), lived and taught in poverty, and died nearly
one hundred years old (Suet., Gramm. 9).

Valerius Cato, another influential teacher, of about the same age with
Cicero himself, lived to an extreme old age, and as a critic of re-
publican poetry, as a teacher and public reader of the Augustan
poets, formed a link between two periods of Roman literature (Suet.,
Gramm. 11).

C. Asinius Pollio, 76 B.C.—5 A.D., by a long and distinguished life
bridged over the long interval between the young manhood of
Cicero and the fourth decade of Augustus’ reign.

M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus, 64 B.C.-8 ΑΛ). had already given great

' promise as an orator before the death of Cicero, and became in
that field, as in several others, one of the chief ornaments of the
Augustan age.

C. Iulius Hyginus, freedman of Augustus, a teacher, and librarian of
the Palatine library, lived from about 64 13.c. to perhaps 17 A.D.,
in the time of Tiberius.

Strabo, the geographer (ca. 63 B.C.-ca. 23 A.D.) also survived the
Augustan age by several years, after a long life of study and

, travel.

Q. Haterius, an orator, not less than twenty years old when the Cato
Maior was written, reached the age of ninety and the year 26 A.D.
(Suet. ap. Hieron., Chron. 778).

Augustus, 63 i3.c.—14 A.D., see below, ξ 60.

Τ. Livius Patavinus (59 B.C.-17 A.D.), the historian, outlived nearly all
the literary men of the Augustan period.

Annaeus Seneca, rhetorician, father of the philosopher Seneca, was
born at least ten years before the writing of the Cato, yet in some
ninety-three years he survived both Augustus and Tiberius, dying
in the reign of Caligula, about 39 A.D. He laments that he might
have heard Cicero but for the civil wars (Contr. 1, praef. 11).
Of these wars, as of the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, he wrote
a history (L. Seneca, frag. 99, Haase).
