M. TVLLI CICERONIS

Quam fuit imbecillus P. Africani filius, is qui te

sadoptavit, quam tenui aut nulla potius valetudine! Quod
ni ita fuisset, alterum illud exstitisset lumen civitatis; ad
paternam enim magnitudinem animi doctrina uberior acces-

serat.

Quid mirum igitur in senibus, si infirmi sint ali-

quando, cum id ne adulescentes quidem effugere possint?
10 Resistendum, Laeli et Scipio, senectuti est, eiusque vitia

diligentia compensanda sunt ; pugnandum tamquam contra
[aa morbum sic contra senectutem, habenda ratio valetudinis,
utendum exercitationibus modicis, tantum cibi et potionis
adhibendum, ut reficiantur vires, non opprimantur.

that matter.'—4. Africani filius:
cf. Index of Persons‚ sat. Cornelius.
The epitaph of this Scipio was
apparently known to Cicero, and
has been discovered in the family
tomb by the Appian Way, within
the present city-walls. The in-
scription says that if he had lived
longer he would easily have sur-
passed the gloria maiorum. —
5. valetudine: cf. 32, 3: eis esse
viribus.-—·5. Quod ni: ‘and if this
had not'; cf. 82, 14.—6. illud:
ille would be expected, but by a
common form of attraction the
pronoun is drawn into the gender
of the predicate (lumen) ς cf. Pltil.
5, 39: Pompeio enim patre, quod
imperio populi Romani lumen fuit,
exstinct0‚· cf. Phil. 2, 54 (nearly
the same words).—-6. lumen: for
the figure, cf. the examples just
cited; fulmen is used in the same
way by Lucretius (3, 1034) of the
elder Africanus, by Vergil (Aen.
6, 842) of the two Africani, by

Cicero (pro Balbo, 34) of Cn. and
P. Scipio.—7. paternam: ‘in-
herited from his father,' but im-
plying that his magnitudo animi
was equal to that of the Elder
Scipio—8. Quid mirum: a for-

mula, often without the verb.—- ”
11. diligentia: ⁴oerefulness,' ‘care,'
not ‘industry' or ‘diligence.'-
11. pugnandum: in a comparison‘
of life with a ship in a storm,
Seneca has luctandum cum ipso
mari (Ep. 108, 37); and else-
where of men unwilling to retire
by reason of age, cum imbecilli·
tate corporis pugnant (Brev-
Vitae, 20, 4). — ια. morbum: there
was a Latin proverb (from the
Greek) : senectus ipsa cst morbus
(Ten, Phorm. 575); Senem went
further, and said: senectics . . .
insanabilis morbus est (Ep. 108,
28). - x 3. exercitationibus: cf. the

saying of Cato : Nam vita hu- ·

mana prope uti ferrum est. Si
exerceas, commitam si non exer·
