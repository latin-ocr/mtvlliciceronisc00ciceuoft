INTRODUCHON

Latium‚1 none is a better representative of that sturdy
stock than Cato, —— a type of the best that Latium in the old
days could produce. As unyielding as the red rocks of
Mount Alba itself, and even more forbidding, — limited in
horizon, like his own lakes os: Albano and Nemi, within
their high crater—walls, —Cato was from first to last a man
of the hills, full of unutterable contempt for all that could
live and thrive only within city gates.2

mother-wit made him a speaker, long practice and intensity
of feeling an orator. Yet at heart he was a farmer‚ and
by second nature a soldier. Accustomed in public life as
in war to give and take the hardest knocks, a keen sense
of humor and a biting tongue made him feared and hated,

agrestibus operibus exercitata, firmissimis praevaluit corporibus, ac militiam'
belli, cum res postulavit, facile sustinuit, durata pacis laboribus, semperque
rusticam plebem praeposuit urbanae. Vt enim qui in villis intra consepta
morarentur, quam qui foris terram molirentur, ignaviores habitos, sic eos qui
sub umbra civitatis intra moenia desides cunctarentur, quam qui rura colerent
segniores visos.'
