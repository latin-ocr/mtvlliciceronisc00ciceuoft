CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[ξ 52-53

dices, propagines nonne efficiunt ut quemvis cum admira-
tione delectent? Vitis quidem, quae natura caduca est et,
nisi fulta est, fertur ad terram, eadem, ut se erigat, clavi· 10
culis suis quasi manibus quicquid est nacta complectitur;
quam serpentem multiplici lapsu et erratico, ferro amputans,
coe'rcet ars agricolarum, ne silvescat sarmentis et in omnes

partes'nimia fundatur.

53. Itaque ineunte vere in eis quae relicta sunt, exsistit
tamquam ad articulos sarmentorum ea quae gemma dicitur,

vitiarium (id. 3, 5, 1) or semina-
rium (ib. 14, 2), since cuttings, as
well as seeds, were semina.—
7. viviradices : ‘quicksets' ; cf. Cato,
R. R. 33, 3; the term is applied
by Varro (R. R. 1, 35, 1), to rose-
slips that have taken root. But
for the vine it is contrasted with
malleoli, and cannot, therefore, have
been used in general of rooted
cuttings ready to transplant from
the nursery. All the words for
cuttings in this passage fall under
two heads (1) ‘ slipS,' viz. malleoli,
sarmenta (interchangeable terms
eventually) and (2) ‘shoots‚' viz.
viviradices, the comprehensive
term, not limited to any one
method of securing a root, and the
special words plantae, z‘.e. from the
root or stem of the parent vine,
and propagines, ‘layersff Of the
two methods (1) was in vogue in
the provinces, while (2) was most
esteemed in Italy ; cf. Columella, 3,
14, 2.—8. nonne efficiunt ut . . .
delectent? not different in sense
from the simple nonne delectant?
—8. cum admiratione: must not

be confused with the simple abla-
tive3 it is pleasure and admira-
tion.— 10. eadem: cf. on 4,11.—
10. claviculis: ‘tendrils '; a di-
minutive of clavis, ⁶ key.' — 12. ser-
pentem: ptcp. with the force of a
temporal clause.÷12. ferro: z'.e.
the pruning—hook. — 13 coercet
ars: a personification less usual
than in English, cf. 54, 10. —-
13. sarmentis: abl. of manner or
means.

53. ineunte vere : pruning (pu-
tatio) took place in the autumn in
warm regions3 but a spring prun-
ing was preferred by most of the
authorities, eg. the Carthaginian
Mag03 cf. Intr., ξ 41 3 Columella,
4, 10, 1.—1. eis: i.e. sarmentis.
—-2. tamquam: inserted because
articulus was still confined in ordi—
nary use to men and animals 3 later
(Pliny, Columella) it was freely
transferred to plants3 but artus of
plants is extremely rare; cf. Pliny,
ΜΗ. 14, 13. —2. ea quae gemma
dicitur: the familiar attraction of
pronouns to predicate, for id qnod,
etc.—2. gemma: ⁴ bud' is the orig-
