CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

3. 'comitate condita codd„ cum aetate condita HE¹K‚ cti etate condita
v¹, conlate condita A¹‚ cv aetate condita Α2 (in marg. comitate condita
et gravitas). — gravitas PHVvlssRS, virtus gravis LHA¹K‚ gravis
virtus E, virtus v23 H has a combination of two rdgs. (gravitas cum
aetate condita virtus gravis).

7. quartum E2R'2, edd„ quartu(m?) Pl, quarto P2HAVvV¹E¹R¹M
rell. 3 H has cum quo consule quarto.

8. Quaestor: the text has been corrupted through misunderstanding
as to where the previous sentence ended (cf. below, on 18, 4). Thus,
Quaestor was thrown back into the preceding sentence in spite of chro-
nology (cf. eg. HV). Beginning then with Deinde, the supposed lack
of an official title was ignorantly supplied by inserting aedilis (but Cato
was not aedile until 199), or praetor (though he was not praetor be·
fore 198). Most of the Mss. —to complete the confusion—combine
both of these interpolations. Thus, quaestor deinde aedilis· quadriennio
post factus sum praetor-quem 1>Ι;·ῑνῐΑ2 marg. H (quadringennio),· cf.
al tarentum questor deinde edilz's v. Ll omits a large part of this, and
has only questor Jffm A¹Br also omit deinde quadriennio post factus
sum. But these omissions are too extensive to prove anything with
regard to deinde. It has therefore been retained in spite of Anz and
Schiche.

15. homo: in reminiscence of Vergil's adaptation (Aen. 6, 846) :

Unus qui nobis cunctando restituis rem,

some M ss. insert qui after lzomo (so ABS¹P, though in the last the word
is marked with dots for omission), while HVvERM have unus qui.

16. Noenum: a conj. of Lachmzffin (on Lucr. 3, 198), Hm„ ML, etc.
The MSS. read non euim,· P has Nenim, whereas to sustain Lachmann
the abbreviation should have been No‘enim‚ which might be an easy
corruption of Noenum (v. Dahl). But the verse is decisive. On noe—
num, cf. Stolz, Histor. Grammatik, 1, pp. 130-131‚ L. 699, R. 86, 2,
Thomas in Class. Rev. 5, 378—379, the last calling attention to the
impossibility of supposing that non is a corruption of noenum, since nolo
is found as far back as the XII Tables, while noenum had not gone
entirely out of use by the time of Ennius, and is found even in Varro.

17. plusque: postque magisque is the reading of the MSS„ both here
and in Off. 1, 84, and is retained by Hm„ Bt., ML, Msn., Sch., as also by
Lucian Miiller in his text of Ennius (Ann. 8) 3 plusque magisque, the
conj. of Bernays has been approved by Vahlen3 priusque magisque
was conj. by Bergk, Sb. For the last it would be easy to assume that
a hasty copyist, failing to see how prius could stand in this context,
