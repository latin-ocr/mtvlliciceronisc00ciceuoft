INTRODUCHON

Asiaticus to trial.l The death of Africanus, though date
and circumstances were disputed even before Livy's time,2
appears to have occurred in 183, before the close of Cato's
term as censor.

29· It is with this high office (184-183) that the name
of Cato has always been most prominently associated.
Once more he had as his colleague in office his friend
L. Valerius Flaccus, having declared that only with the
help of Valerius could he make the censorship effective in
a thorough-going reform of manners and morals.3 The
fears thus aroused in certain quarters were fully realized.
L. Quinctius Flamininus, an ex-consul and brother of the
famous Flamininus, was ejected from the senate for the
reasons given in § 42 of this dialogue.4 The scathing ora-
tion of Cato, an indictment of Flamininus’ vices, was ex·-
tant in Livy's day.5 Six other senators were also dropped
from the list.⁶ A higher valuation and increased taxation
of articles of luxury were devised by Cato as a means of
stemming the tide of extravagance.⁷ He also antagonized
the publicans and contractors in his efforts to secure the
most favorable terms for the state. In all these ways the
censor stirred animosities which followed him to the end
of his life.8

3ο. Among the public works due to Cato and Valerius
were improvements in the drainage of the city and in its
public fountains, with the suppression of abuses in the en-
croachment upon streets or the misappropriation of water.

condemned at the time of election for the censorship of 184, for he stood as a
candidate (Liv. 39, 40, 2).

strict censorship more than ever desirable. 4 Cf. id. 39, 42, 5 ff.
