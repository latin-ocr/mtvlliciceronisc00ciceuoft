CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

while his death was to be the sorest trial of a life which
knew no such thing as peace.

13. Less attractive, but not less characteristic, traits are
seen in Cato the landlord and farmer and slave-owner,
treating everything from the strictly economical stand-
point, selling all things not absolutely needed; hence
heartlessly disposing of slaves who had grown old in his
service.1 Down to his seventieth year he lived in a rough
and unplastered villa,2 proud of nothing more than of his
simple fare.3 Stern simplicity,4 mercilessness toward self,
honor above reproach, a sleepless sense of duty to the
state and his fellow-citizens, a tyrant conscience,—all
these good qualities were conceded to him. But his virtue
was too seli-conscious to be content with its own reward.
It courted admiration, and made of its proud possessor an
inveterate preacher of righteousness in its most repellent
form, reminding gods and men at every turn that other
men are not like Cato. The keenest invective against
others’ shortcomings thus lost a large share of the useful-
ness it might have had, were the preacher less prone to
sound his own praises.

14. At times it would seem that little was lacking to
bring Cato down to the level of the common scold. But
his very commonness‚ the fact that he was through and
through a man of the people‚ devoid of the least suspicion
of artistic taste, and lacking in nearly every one of the
finer feelings, gave all the more force to his blows at the
Scipios, with their foreign culture and unmanly refinement,
