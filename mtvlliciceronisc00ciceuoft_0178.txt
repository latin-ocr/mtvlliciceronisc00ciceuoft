CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

Dahl). The correction to the more familiar emancipata was sure to
be made by the copyists. Certainty is impossible in such a case, but
the more difficult and less obvious reading has beenv restored in the
present text. Archaic mancipata had been corrected to emancipata
before the time of Nonius.

5. sequitur codd„ sequetur R.

9. cum L¹A¹ edd.‚ quam L2PA²VH2 rell. ς H¹ is ambiguous. —augm
rium R, Ml., augurum L*PVvABESM rell„ Hm.; the adj. is rare, but
found de Div. 2, 70 fin„ ad Fam. 3, 9, 3. —pontificium H¹VA² codd„
pontzficum H ²A¹BE1vM.

12. Haec (hec) LVM, Ml.‚ leae PHA rell„ Hm., Bt.‚ heac B.

14. magno opere L¹P¹² edd„ magnopere PHAV rell„ Sch.

17. Quas si codd., edd„ quae siERBr, Sb., Anz, Korn„ quest' Al.

19. agere non possem codd., Hm„ Ml.; Ll has age(rem) in ras. and
omits non possem . acta. vita ; Al (aggre(m)) makes the same omis-
sion3 v omits sed ut . . . acta vita. From L Mom„ Sb., and others
have read quae iam agerem. Semper enim, etc. But if acta vita is
omitted, Semper enim. is left without sufficient logical connection.
Such an omission is not uncommon‚ even in good MSS„ and, especially
on such a point, the authority of LA is not sufficient to outweigh the
other MSS. Msn. brackets quae . . . possem3 defended by A. Otto,
p. 101. BE have non possum‚· V has agerenen (in ras. m. 1) possem.

21. obrepat codd., edd.; ΡΙΑ2 have the rare word obreptat‚ the scn‘be
perhaps imagining that non intellegitur quando could be treated on the
analogy of nescio quis, nescio quo mado, and the like, and hence be
followed by the indicative. The edd. generally hesitate to follow
Madvig¹(on Fin. 1, 11) in connecting viventi with obrepat alone.

39. 3. a codd., edd„ om. A¹vP²¹ER; cf. 71, 113 both constructions
are equally good for Cicer03 cf. Krebs, Antibarbarus, 1⁶, p. 199.

9. voluptatis: bracketed by Bt. —ecfrenate Ρ1 all., effrenate P2L²*H
ΑΞ, frenate L1*A¹.

40. 5. excitari codd„ exercitari AK.

41. 3. posset V¹v (cf. Gemoll), Hm„ Ml., required by sequence, but
possit is found in PLHV2AMK all. (in V acc. to Dahl).

8. tamque pestiferum H2E codd.. om. PH1VvAK ; L omits que pesti-
ferum. The words are bracketed in the text as probably a gloss
(Mommsen) 3 not by the edd.

9. longior L*PHVvAI, Hm„ Bt„ Sb., Msn., Sch.2‚ Anz, longinquior *-

BERSM, ML, Lm. If longior is correct, this is perhaps the only occur-
rence in Cicero of longus in this sense, except with words of time
(Krebs, op. cit. 2⁶, p. 31).
