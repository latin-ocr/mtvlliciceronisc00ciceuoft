tion. With this idea, the translation “for what does the battle of the
giants with the gods signify but rebellion against Nature ?⁷' has been
defended by Ben. (after Nauck). But this form of question is inces-
santly used by Cicero where it is impossible to see even the remotest
notion of interpreting a myth, a law, a statement, etc., or anything but
the dogmatic assertion that A = B. For further discussion by the
editor, and a collection ofexamples, cf. A.J.P. 23, 440-442.

9. 2. artes is generally understood to stand for artes liberales, and
thus to cover all learned occupations‚ with a possible suggestion of the
mental qualities acquired by such discipline. But the concluding words
of the section show in bene actae vitae and benefactorum an ethical
trend, to the exclusion of cultivation, refinement, or learning. For the
moment Cato's thought is concentrated upon the active, useful life,
during which the arma senectutis are forged. ln such a context it is
not easy to make him turn aside to speak of avocations, literary leisure,
scientific recreations, or other means of passing time profitably in· the
leisure moments of a busy life, or later, in the retirement of old age.
It is better to join artes with virtutum and translate ‘principles' or
‘vtheoryss except that the latter word too much suggests mere specula-
tion. Henderson‚ in his edition (Toronto, 1883), translates the whole
phrase ‘the study and practice of moral excellencies.' Or artes may
be taken as ‘character' (cf. mores), since artes is not infrequently a
synonym for virtutes, e.g. Fin. 2, 115 (where Holstein says Cicero fol-
lows the Stoics in that use): non has maximas artes . . . sed quaero
num enstimes . . . Phidian, Polyclitum, Zeuxim ad voluptatem artes
suas derexisse? Cf. Imp. Pomp. 36, where bellandi virtus has as its
companions many other artes‚· cf. Sall. Cat. 2, 43 5, 7 (‘qualities,' as
often in Plautus).
