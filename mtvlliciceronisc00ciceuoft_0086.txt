M. TVLLI CICERONIS

riorem consulatum fuisset; ex quo intellegitur Pyrrhi bello
grandem sane fuisse; et tamen sic a patribus accepimus.
17. Nihil igitur adferunt qui in re gerenda versari senec-
tutem negant, similesque sunt ut si qui gubernatorem in
navigando nihil agere dicant, cum alii malos scandant, alii
per. foros cursent, alii sentinam exhauriant, ille autem cla-

5vum tenens quietus sedeat in puppi.

to the censor's office. But Appius
Claudius was in every way a most
exceptional man. — 12. et tamen:
with the same force as in 1. 73 τῖε.
putting aside our calculastons, we
have still the evidence of tradition;
cf. Munro on Lucr. 1, 1050.—-12.
sic : referri ng back to grandem sane
fuisse. It cannot refer, in a more
general way, to his influence on
public policy, for that was suffi-
ciently attested by the publication
and preservation of the speech.
17. in re gerenda: it is of pub-
lic life and state affairs that Cato
is thinking almost exclusively: cf.
the figure of the pilot, suggesting
the ship of state. Plutarch wrote
on the question An seni sit res
publica gerenda, —if we may cite
a Greek essay by its Latin title. --
2. similesque . . . ut si qui: ut si
with pres. or perf. suij. is one of
the regular forms for the imaginary
illustration. But the exemplum
fictum is often at the same time a
simile; hence similes in the text,
and similiter in the following ex-
ample (in a quotation): similiter

facere . . .

ut si nautae certarent,
quis eorum potissimum gubernaret
(deOff. 1, 873 cf.T..D4,41)

The combination similis ut si is,
however, very rare. - 3. nihil
agere· z..e ‘is of no importance';

cf. 15, 10. —4. foros :sori on ship-
board were narrow gangways, ex·
tending fore and aft, close to the
sides of the ship,—distinct from
the deck ( pons) . — 4. exhauriant:
the pump was invented about
the time of Cato by Ctesibius
of Alexandria, and no doubt used
on shipboard. The ship is under
sail, hence no mention is made of
the oarsmen.— 4. clavum: ‘tiller'z
though the ancient ship did not
have a rudder. Instead two large
steering-oars were so rigged as to
work together. Cf. Ennius, Ann-
568, Miiller: —-

Dum clavom rectum teneam na-
vemque gubernem.

—5. Ne faciat: sc. scadan a'
formula of concession, followed by
certe, at, at vero, etc.; cf. 34, 93
or affirmatively, 84, 23 cf. App.—
