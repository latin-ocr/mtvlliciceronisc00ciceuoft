CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

And they would have been certain to protest, if Cicero had
contrived to undermine the pedestal‚ and bring him down
to the level of common men. A real and undistorted
likeness would have given offence at every turn, even if
we could assume that the writer was capable of producing
such a likeness.

apprehension of the man,—at least to avery large extent.
To have grasped the true Cato only a century after his
death, would have required a keener sense of historical
perspective than Cicero usually shows.

omni virtule excellentem probo. Cf. de Re Pub. 2, 1.
