CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

Valerius assumed the construction of certain harbor·works,
and improved the route of the Appian Way at Formiae,
while Cato built an exchange, the Basilica Porcia,¹ at one
side of the Comitium, between the Curia and the carcer.
This was of historical importance as the first building of
its kind in Rome—the precursor of the great basilicas.
The next censors followed Cato’s example with the Basilica
Aemilia,2 on the northeast side of the Forum, while ten
years later Sempronius built his basilica 3 west of the Castor
temple, on ground afterward occupied by one end of the
great Basilica Iulia. A statue of Cato was placed by the
grateful plebs in the temple of Salus on the Quirinal,
with an inscription which passed over his other public
services, only to dwell at greater length on his reforms as ·
censor.4 ’

its end, but for thirty-five years more he continued to live
a life of the greatest activity and influence, deprived, how-
ever, from the year 180, of the help of his faithful friend
Valerius Flaccus, who died as pontifex in the pestilence of
that year.5 During this period we hear of him as the
champion of provincials, ag. the Spaniards in 171}3 as again

¹ Liv. 39, 44, 73 Plut., Cato, 19. The speech of Cato entitled Vti basilica
aedficelur no doubt justified the innovation. One fragment is preserved by
Priscian, 8, p. 433, Keil; Jordan, p. 51.

² Liv. 40, 51, 5. ³ ld. 44, 16, 10.

4 Plut., Cato, 19. Cato had previously ridiculed statues, preferring, so he
claimed, to live in the memory os men, and to have men ask why he had no
statue, rather than why he had one (Plut., ib. ,· Ammian. 14. 6, 8). Another
statue of Cato, apparently of later date, stood in the senate-house, while the
memory of Africanus was honored by a statue in the central cella os the Capi·
toline temple (Val. Max. 8, 15, 1-2). The feeling that the censor and the
hero of Zama deserved equal honors is reflected in Seneca, Ep. 87, 9:
M. Calo Censorius, quem tam e re publica fuit nasci quam Scipionem, alter
enim cum hostibus nostris bellum, alter cum moribus gessit, . . .
