INTRODUCHON

ments and illustrations employed in the fourth part of the
present dialogue (on the nearness of death to the old man)
and those previously used in the first book of the T asculan
Dzkputatz'ons. Upon that book he must have been engaged
in the summer of 45, for as early as May we find him ask-
ing Atticus for books on the subject.1 Mueh of the same
material reappears in the Cato, not as though copied from
the earlier work, but with every appearance of a free re-
casting from memory‚ thus implying a comparatively short
interval between the first book of the T asculan Disputa-
tions and the Cato. Yet this point is not to be urged too
strongly, for the reason that many of the arguments con-
cerned were of a stereotyped order, and the illustrations
commonplaces.

The book was written in haste, and some months later
revised with equal haste.2 Cicero himself in a letter to
Atticus3 speaks of sending him the Cato revised crebris
locis. Not a few of the defects in logical connection may
perhaps be traced back to this double recension. Atticus’
c0pyists were guilty occasionally‚ it may be, of inserting
Cicero's additions in the wrong place.4
