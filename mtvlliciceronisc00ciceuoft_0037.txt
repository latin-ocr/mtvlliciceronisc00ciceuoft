INTRODUCI'ION

he comes to the rescue of the Rhodians four years later.1
In 155, when Athens sent to Rome the celebrated em-
bassy of philosopherS, Carneades, Critolaus, and Diogenes
(the Stoic of that name), Cato, alarmed at their favora-
ble reception by the nobles, and the impression their elever
debates made upon the younger generation, urged that they
should be- sent away immediately.2

32. As the final conflict with Carthage approached, Cato
showed himself the uncompromising advocate of war. Sent
over to Africa,3 he saw in the great prosperity of Carthage
a constant menace to Rome. Nothing but-the destruction
of the rival city would satisfy him. At every step in the
direction of war he was opposed by the temperate counsels
of Scipio Nasica.4 About this time Cato’s son died in his
praetorship.5 The simplicity of the funeral was suited to
the tastes and poverty—the well-paraded poverty—of Cato.

33. The last important case in which Cato took a promi-
nent part‚—-this within a few months, perhaps not many

² Plut., Cato, 22; Plin.‚ N. H. 7, 112: quam primum legatos eos censuit
dimittendos, quoniam illo viro (sc. Carneade) argumentante quid veri esset
haud facile discerni posset. On the embassy, cs. de Orat. 2, 155 ff.; Acad. 2, .
137; ad Att. 12, 23, 23 Τ. D. 4, 5; Gell. 6, 14, 93 17, 21, 483 Macrob.,
Sat. 1, 5, ¹5; Lact. 5, 15; cs. above, 5 19, n. 2.

⁸ Plut„ Cato, 273 App.‚ Fun. 69; perhaps Liv., per. 47 fin. The date os
this embassy is usually given as 157 (Liv. ib„ med), but without sufficient
authority. A later date (153) is sar more probable. Jager, splarcus Porcius
Cato, Gtitersloh, 1892, pp. 44, 69, thinks the whole story suspicions.

⁴ Liv.,per. 48-49; St. Augustine‚ C. l). 1, 30; App.‚ l. c.,· Florus, Ι, 31, 4:
Cato inexpiabili odio delendam esse Carthaginem, et cum de alio consuleretur,
pronuntiabat, Scipw Nasica servandam, ne metu ablato aemulae urbis luxu-
riari felicitas inciperet,· cf. Plut„ Calo, 273 Plin.‚ Ν. H.‚ 15, 74; Aur. Vict.
473 below, ἓ 18 ; but the formula Ceterum censeo Carthaginem, etc., is with-
out authority. On one occasion, in his (lesence of the Rhodians, Cato quoted
the opinion of the Elder Africanus, that Carthage should be permitted to
remain, lest the Romans grow insolent and careless in their prosperity. Cf.
App.‚ Pun. 65. ⁵ Liv., per. 48.
