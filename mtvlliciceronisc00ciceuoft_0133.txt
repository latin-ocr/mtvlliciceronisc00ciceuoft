[ἓ 56

assiduique domini referta cella vinaria, olearia, etiam pe-
naria est, villaque tota locuples est, abundat porco, haedo,

agno, gallina, lacte, caseo, melle.
lae succidiam alteram appellant.

Iam hortum ipsi agrico-
Conditiora facit haec

supervacaneis etiam operis aucupium atque venatio.

self3 cf. on 52, 2.—16. cella vi-
naria: not ‘ wine-cellar,' except in
the loosest translation, for the cella
was above ground, often in the
upper part of the house. A north
exposure was recommended by
the architects (Vitruvius, 6, 6 [9] 3
cf. Varro, R. R. 1, 13, 7).—
16. olearia: this and the cella
vinaria were of the greatest im-
portance,—the only cellae men-
tioned by Cato in his list of
necessary farm-buildings (R. R. 3,
23 cf. Varro, R. R. 1, 13, 63 Co-
lumella, 1, 6, 9). A warm exposure
was recommended (Varro, l.c. ἓ 7 ;
Vitruv. l.c.).—16. penaria: Cato
had praised the fertility of Sicily
by calling it cellam penariam
rei publicae nostrae (Verr. 2, 5).
-17. villaque: villa rustica, the
farm buildings, as distinguished
from villa urbana, the country-
house of the owner (Cato, R. R.
3—4).—-17. porco . . . gallina:
collective, of the living anima1s3
their flesh would be porcina, hae-
dina, agm‘na, caro gallinarum. —
18. Iam: like iam vero, ‘more-
over'3 cf. 72, 123 74, 1381, 1.—
19· succidiam alteram: ‘a second
side of bacon,' i.e. as certain a
dependence in any emergency as

the supply of salted or smoked
pork. The proverb is found no-
where else. As the derivation
from succido shows, succidia was
a piece cut off. It was hung upon
the carnarium to be smoked.
WVhether because pork was long
the only meat smoked or salted,
or from a false etymology (as
though from sus and caedo, Varro,
L. L. 5, 110), the word was con-
fined to pork, and meant a ‘ side ’ or
‘flitch of bacon'3 Varro, R. R. 2,
4, 3, and ἓξ 10-11 (quoting Cato).
In a figurative sense Cato, in an

oration, used it of a brutal and ,

wholesale murder (Gellius, 13, 25,
12). A connection with succedo
was at least sometimes assumed;
as by Nonius (170, 25 M.): Suc-
cidiam, successionem necessariam,
quoting this place. —19. conditi-
ora: cf. condita, 10, 3.—19. facit:
becomes passive in English, as
inversion of the voice is necessary,
that an effective order of words
may be kept. —2o. supervacaneis
. operis: ‘by spare-hour occu-
pations,' with some suggestion of
employments held in reserve,—
not required by the routine of the
estate. Hunting was a favorite
sport of the Romans.
