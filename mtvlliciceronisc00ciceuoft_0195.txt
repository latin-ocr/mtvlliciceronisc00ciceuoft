INDEX OF PE RSONS

C. Duilius (ξ 44). As cos. 260 he defeated the Carthaginian fleet off
Mylae, west of Messina (C.1.L. 1, 195).

Q. Ennius (ἐξ 1, 10, 14, 16, 50, 73), 239-169, born in Calabria, but
served in the Roman army in Sardinia, whence Cato brought him to
Rome. By his poetry he won a high place among the earliest Roman
writers. From his historical poem, Annales, as also from his tragedies,
Cicero quotes incessantly. Fragments only remain, but these are very
numerous. Cf. Intr., ἕξ 11, 2ο, 24.

Epicurus (ξ 43), 341—270, the philosopher, and founder of the school
which bore his name. His teachings were best represented for the
Romans of Cicero's time by the didactic poem of Lucretius, which
seems, however, to have made but a slight impression upon Cicero him-
self 3 for he always accepted the current misinterpretation by which the
pleasure which Epicurus made the summum bonum was understood to
mean the sensual pleasure of the moment, and not the intellectual and
lasting pleasure—the complete absence of disturbing emotions, which
Epicurus meant when he talked of ἡδονή.

Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus Cunctator (ἐξ 1ο-13, 15, 39, 61), cos.
233, 228, 215, 214, 2ο9; censor 2303 dictator 217. The most conspicu-
ous figure on the Roman side in the Second Punic War‚ in spite of his
advanced years: he won for himself the title of ‘ Delayer' by his wise,
but unpopular, tactics against Hannibal. Cato was under many per-
sonal obligations to Fabius (Plut. Rei publicae gerendae praecepta 1 1 ;
An seni sz'tgerenda r. p. 12fin.). He died ²03 (Liv. 30, 26, 7).

Q. Fabius Maximus (ξ 12), son of the preceding, cos. 213, but died
before his father.

C. Fabricius Luscinus (ξς 15, 43)2 cos. 282, 2783 censor 2753 con-
spicuous in the war with Pyrrhus, but best known for his virtues and
incorruptible honesty. He died in poverty‚ and was honored by burial
within the walls. He was constantly mentioned with Curius and
Coruncanius.

Flaccus, v. Valerius.

Flamininus, v. Quinctius.

C. Flaminius (ξ 11), cos. 223 and ²173 censor 22ος builder os the
Via Flaminia (to Ariminum-the first road over the Apennines) and
the Circus F laminius; the first great demagogue, always at odds with
the patrician83 noted for his independence, and defiance of omens3
was entrapped at the Trasimene, and lost his life in battle with Hanni-
bal, 217.

L. Furius Camillus (ξ 41), dictator 350, cos. 349, son of the great
Camillus ; fought against Gallie invaders in the ager Pomptinus.
