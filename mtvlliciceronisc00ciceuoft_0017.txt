INTRODUCTION

Nam vita humana prope uti ferrum est. Si exerceas, conteritur ,·
si non exerceas, tamen robigo interficit. — CATO, ap. Gell. 11, 2, 6.

Ι. C1CERo's METHOD IN THE CATO MAIOR

1. For an essay eustom prescribed the thin disguise of .

dialogue. One may therefore think of the essay on Old
Age as but loosely connected with the name and person·
ality of the great censor, and assume that Cicero used Cato
merely as a mouthpiece for his own opinions, aware that
his readers would not be deceived‚ or find fault with a
necessary concession to literary fashion. From this stand-
point‚ the student of the Cato Maior would need most of
all to inform himself as to the philosophical teachings of
Cicero, and the series of works- in which they were set
forth. But the philosophy in this dialogue is more trans·
parent than usual. It is out of actual practice, far more
than out of theory, that a defence of old age is con-
structed. And the practical experience of all who are
cited as examples is merged in the one centra] personality
of Cato.

2. Catonem induxi senem disputantem, quia nulla vide-
batur aptior persona, quae de illa aetate loqueretur, quam
eius qui et diutissime senex fuisset et in ip5a senectute
praeter ceteros floruisset, . . . Genus autem ltoc sermonum
positum in hominum veterum anctoritate, et eorum inlu-
strium, plus nescio quo pacto videtur habere gravitatis ,-

z'taque zpse mea legens sic adficior interdum, ut Catonem,
