INTRODUCHON

portion of the work1 has sared no better than the re-
mainder‚ the later treatise on farming has been preserved,
and may be regarded as an enlarged and revised edition
of the counsels first given to his son.

Whatever of practical rules and observations for the
orator Cato may have included in his Praecepta, it was at
least enough to give him his place as the oldest Roman
writer on rhetoric.2

The legal maxims were still read three hundred years
aster his death,3 but they were fruitful chiefly in encourag-
ing his older son to more successful labors in the same field}-

The military wisdom of Cato must also have been of a
very practical kind, — the results of long and hard experi-
ence as soldier, officer, and commander.5

Moribus, and consisted of wise sayings and reminders of
ancient custorn.6 It appears to have been written in verse.⁷

formed by Greek physicians against all foreigners: Iurarunt inter se barbaros
necare omnis medicina, Plin„ N. H. 29, 14; Jordan, p. 77. It is interesting
to find that in this work Cato asserted that vigor in age was a signuof ap-
proaching death: senilem iuventam praematurae mortis esse szjgnum, Plin.,
N. H. 7, 171 ; Jordan, p. 78.

1 Eight brief fragments, Jordan, pp. 78-79. Here also the same oracular
style, e.g. quod non opus est, asse carum est, frag. 10, Jordan, p. 79 (from
Sen„ Ep. 94, 27); and quod tibi deerit, a le ipso mutuare, frag. 13, ib. (from
Sen„ Ben. 5, 7, 5). Also Vergil’s laudato ingentia rura Ι exaegruam colito
(Georg. 2, 412—413) seems to have been borrowed from Cato: lzoc etiam Cato
ait in libris ad filium de agri cultura, Servius, ad loc. (Jordan, ἰὰ).

condidit aliqua in hanc materiam M. Cato ille Censorius, . . . From this
work were cited the well-known sayings: Orator est, Asarce fili, vir bonus,
dicendi peritus (Sen., Contr. 1, pr. 9fin.; Quint. 12, 1, 1) and Rem tene,
verba sequentur (Iul. Victor); Jordan, p. 80, three fragments.

⁵ Fisteen fragments are brought together by Jordan, pp. 80-82.

⁶ Gellius, 11, 2, preserves the only extant fragments (three); Jordan, pp.
82-83. Cf. note on 35, 13: Intr., ἐξ 20 n. 4, 21 n. 1.
