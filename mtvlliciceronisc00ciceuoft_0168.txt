CATO MAIOR *DE SENECTVTE

3. 3. aristoceus R, Aristo Chius LEA¹‚ aut aristo P (with erasure
of Cius) H, aut aristo Α”2 marg„ aristoteles, SV‘, aristotiles 1313 Hm.
reads Ceus, Ml. Cius. That the Stoic Aristo of Chios is here meant,
not the Peripatetic of Keos, Giesecke tries to prove in F leck. Jb. 145
(1892), 206 ff. J. Grimm was of the same opinion in his Rcde tiber
das Alter.

4—5. quo maiorem auctoritatem haberet oratio: bracketed by Msn.
(after Polle, F leck. Jb. 131, 807), but the clause is needed as explaining
Cicero's motive in choosing Cato. The repetition of auctoritatem astet
auctoritatis is careless, but there is no sufficient reason for doubting
the reading. Something might be said against parum enim, etc„ as
a gloss incorporated with the text. More probably we have here, as
elsewhere, an evidence of a double recension, — τῖε. Cicero's own altera·
tions and corrections3 cf. A. Otto, pp. 96-97 3 cf. on 20, 7 : Veientes, fin.

8. suis libris codd.. Charisius, 198 K„ Hm., Ml., libris suis PEAd.—
id tribuito LP²vBr‚ Sb.,*Anz, Korn. , id tribuitur Al, tribuito Vi, attri-
buito P1H1A2BRS (I inserting hoc),qu M1„Sch.‚adtr1buito V, at-
tribuit(u)r H'2E. Cf. ad Herenn. 4, 48: ld tribuite vestrae culpae· ‚ but
de Orat. 2, 14. Hoc tu si cupidiusfactum existimas, Caesari attribues.

4. 6. difficilem: LAVvM, ML, have the word* m this position; PH
(suprascr. m. 1)ESBR, Hm, Sch.‚ place the adj. after the names, which
thus stand between sane and the adj.· m a most improbable fashion.

9. ipsi LPR1V, ML, ipsis HBER2Sv‚ rim—potest malum PBRS,
Hm., Bt., malum potest LHAVv, ML, Korn., Sch.‚ mali potest ΕΚ.

12. adeptam Ll (so Dahl, L2 according to Mommsen) PHVvBRSI
M, Hm., adepto Α2 (apparently, with gloss: consecutam), adepti L²
(Dahl, Ι), Mommsen) A¹EK, Ml. The latter has been more generally
accepted, but the former is more forcible, and would be likely to be
corrected out of the text by a copyist who thought be had detected an
error, and forgot how many perf. ptcpp. os dep. verbs were used by
Cicero in the pass. sense.

13. putassent LH R, putavissent PAVvViBESM.

¹7· si (octogesimum) LP²V³vK, om. codd. rell.. Hm. —octogeeimmnt
both P and L have octoginta.

18. consolatio LPBRSKM‚ Bt., Ml., consolatione HEI, Hm., Sb.

5. 5. discriptae L¹VA, descriptae codd. rell.

ιο. Quid est enim: Some have preferred to see in this a question as
to the meaning of the story of the giants‚ suggesting a rational interpre-
tation of the myth, aster the manner of Cato's contemporary, Euhemerus
(translated by Ennius), or of the Stoics‚ who set themselves the task of
explaining away the old legends by an allegorioel method of interpreta-
