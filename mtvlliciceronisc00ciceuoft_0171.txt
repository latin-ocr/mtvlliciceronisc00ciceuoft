substituted post. But the unanimity of the Mss. in two passages (this
and Off. l.c.) is a striking fact‚-and the corruption must be very old. For
the difference in meaning between plus and magite, ef. Tegge, Studien
zur latet‘nzlsclten S ynonymik, p. 255 ( plus as comp. of multum, magis as
comp. of magnopere). It is safe to say, however, that old Ennius, if he
wrote plusque magisque, did not draw any refined distinction, but placed
the words side by side merely sor cumulative effect.

11. 3. fuerat in arce L¹HA1V1P2BrM‚ Sb., ΑΗΖ, Korn„ Sch.,ficgerat
in arce P1L²V²A2Sz all.‚ fugerat in arcem v, Hm.9 Ml. ln view of the
length of time (three years) during which Macatus defended the citadel,
fuerat is all but certain. On Cicero's error, cf. A.J.P. 19, 437.

12. 1. nihil LAEV, nihil est PHBRS, Hm.

2. mortem filii VQ and H (with marcii suprascr. m. 1), but mortem
M. filii P, mortem marcz'filiz' AV³v3 the same error in L and other MSS.
The son's name was Quintus.

9. [bella]: bracketed by Msn., Sb„ Otto (p. 103); apparently in-
serted by copyists who did not understand the general ternis domestica,
externa ,- om. Ws.

10. fruebar: L has fruebatur corrected to fruebar (Dahl); BEIRS
have perfruebar.—iam tum: conj. ed.; the MSS. and edd. show un-
certainty as to the position of tum (tunc) 3 thus— after fruebar (tunc)
H2R‚ aster perfruebar (tunc) BESI. lt is omitted by LVvAMP (so
Dahl for P, which has been usually cited as showing tum cupide). If
the tum should not be omitted entirely, we may place it after iam.
Mommsen restored fruebar tum out of the uncorrectedfruebatur in L;
Hm„ Ml. read ita tum cupide fruebar.

13. 1. Quorsum V³, cursum L¹A1‚ quorsus PV, etc.

7. uno et octogesimo: the combination — however written —is really
a compound word, as truly in the masc. forrns as in the legio unetvi-
cesima so often mentioned by Tacitus, eg. Ann. 1, 64.—et LE, om.
PBRS, etc. (also H, inverting the numerals).

ιο. se dicit P (in ras.), se dz'czYur A, dicitur HV codd.

14. 4. Sicut Ml, sicuti PHAVv rell„ llic ut Lucian Miiller in his edi-
tion of Ennius (Bk. 17), accepting Baehrens's conj. ; Miiller also conj.

Corpus. Poet. Lat.).

5. Olumpia Reid, Ben, olimpia HBIRS, olt'mplzia L*‚ olymphia Vv,
Olympia edd.

7. anno: nearly all the Mss. have the acc. annum enim undevicesi-
