CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[ἓ 10-11

senex suasor legis Cinciae de donis et muneribus fuit.
Hic et bella gerebat ut adulescens, cum plane grandis esset,
et Hannibalem iuveniliter exsultantem patientia sua mollie-
bat ; de quo praeclare familiaris noster Ennius:

Vnus lemno nobis cunctando restituit rem.
Noenum rumores ponebat ante salutem ,-
Ergo plusque magisque viri nunc gloria claret.

11. Tarentum vero qua vigilantia, quo consilio recepit!
curn quidem me audiente Salinatori, qui amisso oppido

cf. L. 1868.—11. legis Cinciae:
the lex Cincz'a muneralzlr, proposed
by a brother of the historiari L.
Cincius Alimentus, forbade all
gifts exceeding a fixed value, ex-
cept between near relatives, and a
few other persons, as specified in
the law. The purpose of this
plebiscite was to release the poorer
classes from paying a kind of
tribute in the form of gifts to the
richer (so Cato in a speech in Livy,
34, 4, 9). Advocates were either
expressly forbidden to accept sees,
or by implication‚ from their omis-
sion in the list of exceptions. Most
of the references to the law have
to do with legal fees.—-13. pa-
tientia: much stronger than our
word. — 14. de quo praeclare :
omission of the verb of saying
before a quotation from a poet is
very common.—15. Vnus: these
were very well-known lines of
Ennius, and the first of them be-
came proverbial (cf. Otto, Sprz'clz-
w’o'rter der R'o'mer, p. 101); cf.
App. — 15. rem: rem publicam,

71

as res Romana is res publica Ro-
manorum.—- 16. Noenum: an old
negative3 the derivation is not
certain, but probably it represents
ne-oinom or (later) ne-oenum, ne-
unum, ‘not a thing,' ⁴ naught ' ; cf.
App. - 16. rumores: slanderous
reports of his supposed cowardice.
Feeling at Rome ran high against
Fabius, especially in his dictator-
ship, 217.— 16. ponebat: cf. on
versat, 1, 2.— 17. plusque ma-
gisque: Ennius probably did not
make the usual distinction be-
tween these words, viz. that plns:
multum :zmagz's z magnopere. Cf.
App.

11. 2. cum quidem: with in-
dic. (inquz't); cf. on 10, 103 in
English, ‘It was at that time, by
the way.' This makes Tarentum
the scene of the story, not Rome
in the next year (208), as Livy has
it (l.c. infra). In Livy the retort
was made in the senate, of which
Cato was not yet a member.—
2. Salinatori: for the confusion of
Salinator with his relative Macatus.
