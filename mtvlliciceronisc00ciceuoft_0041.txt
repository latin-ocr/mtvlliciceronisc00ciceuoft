INTRODUCHON

pontifical annals,¹ he freed himself from the limitations of
official years and magisterial terms, to trace in broad lines
a patriotic story, in which every individuality, except per-
haps his own, was lost in the daring and doing of a state,
not impersonal‚ nor yet personified, but immeasurably
greater than its greatest citizens.

The first Roman history in Latin, the first important
work of any kind in Latin prose,—this was what the aged
Cato produced in his Origines. Though in style and treat-
ment we may well imagine that the work left much to be
desired, still its loss is deeply to be regretted‚ from more
than one standpoint. We are forced to judge of it by the
numerous citations and allusions in later writers.2

37. Orations, in their published form, were for Cato less
a department of literature in themselves than a supplement
' to his history. Many of his speeches not incorporated in
the Origines were published separately. More than 150
were known to Cicero ; 3 brief fragments of eighty remam}
They continued to be read to a certain extent down to the

doned the annalistic form, and having done so, where could he have inserted
such lists ? Cf. Wachsmuth‚ op. cit, p. 624.

1 Cf. Non lubet scribere, quod in tabula apud pontificem maximum est,
quotiens annona cara, etc„ ap. Gen. 2, 28, 63 Jordan, p. 16, fr. 1; these words
of Cato himself, in connection with Nepos' capitulatim (3, 4), leave no doubt
as to the abandonment of the old annalistic arrangement. The meaning of
capitulatim is, however, a matter of dispute ; the different views are sum-
marized by Vollertsen, Quaestt. Coton„ Kiel, 1880, pp. 45-46; cf. Jordan,
pp. lii ff.

² Fronto, in his Principia Historiae, gave a high place to Cato: ita Cato
. oppidatim statuis ornandus, qui primam Latini nominis subolem et Itali-
carum originum pueritias inlustravit: a fragment, Naber, p. 203. In late
writers we may find a reflection of Sallust’s opinion of Cato; thus, eg„
in Ampelius (second century also), Lib. Mem, 19: Hic est omnium rerum
peritissimus et, ut Sallustio Crispo videtur, Romani generis disertissimus.

”Bruma 653 all of Cato's speeches began, according to the old custom,
with a prayer to Jupiter, or some other divinity; Serv„ Aen. 7, 259; 11, 301;
cf. Demosthenes, de Corona, init. ⁴Jordan‚ p. 33 ff.
