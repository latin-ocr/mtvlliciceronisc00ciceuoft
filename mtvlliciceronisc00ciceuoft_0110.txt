M. TVLLI CICERONIS

sunt exercitationes ingeni, haec curricula mentis, in his
desudans atque elaborans eorporis viris non magno opere
15 desidero. Adsum amicis, venio in senatum frequens ultro-
que adfero res multum et diu cogitatas, easque tueor animi,

- non corporis viribus.

Quas si exsequi nequirem, tamen

me lectulus meus oblectaret ea ipsa cogitantem quae iam
agere non possem ; sed ut possim, facit acta vita. Semper
20enim in his studiis laboribusque viventi non intellegitur

quando obrepat senectus.

Ita sensim sine sensu aetas

senescit, nec subito frangitur, sed diuturnitate exstinguitur.

reduco (Nonius, 91, 9 M.‚ citing
this place). — 12. Haec: for ltae a
number of times in Cicero; cf.
Τ. D. 1, 22, Heine.—- 14. desudans:
keeping to the figure of athletic
exercise.— 15. Adsum amicis: in
the usual sense, of giving aid and
counsel in coum—15. frequens:
H. 4973 A. ¹9¹3 G. 325, R. 63
B. 239. The meaning is ‘regu-
larly,' ‘constantly,⁷ rather than
‘ frequently.'— 15. ultroque adfero :
the privilege of introducing new
business belonged to the presiding
magistrate alone. But any sena-
tor who had the floor could digress
from the subject of debate without
being ruled out of order. On
Cato's practice, cf. Intr., ξ 32, n. 4.
—16. tueor: of supporting an ar-
gument, maintaining one's opin-
ions. -— 18. lectulus: cf. Senem,
Ep. 67, 2: Ago gratias senectuti,
quod me lectulo aetsin't. The lec-
tulus was much used sor reading
and wrifing, and does not suggest
idleness. Thus Ovid in exile com-
plains (Trist. 1, 11, 37 f.) that he

is not writing in his garden nor
upon his study-lounge:

Nec, consuete, meum, lectule, cor-
pus habes.

— 20. viventi: the verb obrepere,
or an equivalent, was in the
writer's mind when he began
the sentence; hence the dative
would be looked sor. But viwrm'
cannot be altogether separated
from intellegitur. The indefinite-
ness of the construction is natural,
since non intellegetur is much like
‘there is no telling.’ Translate,
‘For a man who lives his whole
life . . .' Cf. App.—21. obrepat:
cf. 4.15.—21. sensim sine sensu
. . . senescit: alliteration and as-
sonance combine with the oxy-
moron (sensim sine sensu) in a
studied and eminently successful
effort to describe vividly‘the im·

perceptible advance of age3 sensim .

as thus qualified by its opposite
loses its idea of ‘sensibly,' ‘per-
ceptibly'; cf. on 39, ²3 16, 5.—
52. exstinguitur: cf. 71, 8.
