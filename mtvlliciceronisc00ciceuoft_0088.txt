ξ 19] M. TVLLI CICERONIS

excipient anni consequentes. Anno ante me censorem
5 mortuus est, novem annis post meum consulatum, cum

consul iterum me consule creatus esset.

Num igitur, si ad

centesimum annum vixisset, senectutis eum suae paeniteret?
Nec enirn excursione nec saltu nec eminus hastis aut com-
minus gladiis uteretur, sed consilio, ratione, sententia.

nostri appellassent senatum.

185ς but authorities differed
strangely between this date and
183. Livy while mentioning (39,
50, 10) the opinion (Polybius)
that Scipio died in the same year
with Hannibal and Philopoemen
(183), himself decides (ib. 52,1-2)
in favor of 185, because in the
censorship of Cato and Valerius
(Intr.‚ ξ 29) the latter was named
princeps senatus to succeed Scipio,
who, he argues, must therefore
have been dead—5. post meum
consulatum: the reckoning here
(if novem is correct) must be from
the end of Cato's consulship, tle.
15 March,194.—5. cum . . . cre—
atus esset: ef. on 16, 9.—6. ad
centesimum: by this unfortunate
expression Cicero leaves the reader
with the impression that Scipio
(born 235) was much older than
Cato, whereas the difference be-
tween their ages was not more
than one year, and Scipio at the
time of his death was little more
than fifty.—7. paeniteret: ‘find
fault with: ‘ be discontented with'3
imperf„ because Scipio would still

be living, with some fifteen years
to spare before he attained ad cen-
tesimum annum.—8. Nee enim:
in translation this sentence must
be introduced by a negative im-
plied in the num-question pre-
ceding. Nec is merely correlative
to nec . . . nec.— 8. excursione .
saltu : the reference is not to actual
warfare, for a Scipio, even in his
youth, would have been very differ·
ently employed in war from the
common soldier. Cicero has in
mind drill and military exercises‚
especially those of the light-armed
and agile velites, and a.l is con-
sistent with the general idea of
vigorous manly exercise, such as
had formed the early training of
Africanus, and delights the heart of
youth everywhere. Edturu’o is
‘skirmish—drill, ' rather than the
real skirmishing of the levis arma-
tura. —8. hastis: the velites con-
tinued to mrry hastae (and gladii)
long after the legionaries were
armed with the pilum3 ef. Livy,
26, 4, 43 38, 20, 13 ib. 21, 13.—

concilium would be expected,—
