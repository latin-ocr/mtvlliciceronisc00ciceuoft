CATO MAIOR DE SENECFVTE

[ἒ 48-49.

48. Quod si istis ipsis voluptatibus bona aetas fruitur
libentius, primurn parvulis fruitur rebus, ut diximus, deinde
eis quibus senectus, etiamsinon abunde potitur, non omnino

caret.

Vt Turpione Ambivio magis delectatur qui in

prima cavea spectat, delectatur tamen etiam qui in ultima, 5
sic adulescentia voluptates propter intuens magis fortasse
laetatur, sed delectatur etiam senectus procul eas spectans

tantum quantum sat est.

49. At illa quanti sunt, animum tamquam emeritis sti-
pendiis libidinis, ambitionis, contentionum, inimicitiarum,

‘be without.'—8. Quamquam: cf.
on 1, 7.—9. lioc: attributive to
non desiderare ,- cf. L. 2215.

48. istis: cf. on 46, 6. — 1. vo-
luptatibus . . . fruitur: cf. Varro,
Tithonus, Sat. Men. 545, Biich.:
multz'cupida iuvenitas.——- 1. bona
aetas: conversely old age was
often mala aetas,· cf. Turpilius in
Nonius, 1, 15 M:—

Miseru‘m puto, sz' etiam istuc ad
malam aetatem accessit mali.

—2. ut diximus: referring to the
general tone of 45 and 46, and the
contrast of higher with lower pleas-
ures.— 3. potitur: z'.e.fruitnr,· cf.
39, 10: potiendum, z'.e. fruendum.
-4. Turpione Ambivio ε where
the praenomen was omitted, as
if by compensation, the more dis-
tinctive cognomen was often put
before the generic nomen in col-
loquial Latin (and later in Silver
Latin prose); but more formally,
Lucius Ambz‘vius T urpio.—4. in
prima cavea: Cicero ignores the

1¹5

fact that in Cato's time, when
plays were given, no regular pro-
vision was made for seating the
audience. The early custom had
been to stand. In the theatre as
Cicero knew it—both the tem-
porary wooden structures and the
one permanent theatre of Pompey
—prima cavea meant the lowest
tiers of scats in the long semi-
circular rows rising one above the
other to the top of the theatre
(ullzbna, or summa cavea). The
level orchestra was reserved for
senators; behind them, in the
prima cavea, sat the knights, in
the first fourteen rows. —6. prop-
ter: here an adv„ the opposite of
procul (l. 7).

. illa: ‘it'3 a following in—
finitive is often anticipated by
illud. The plural here, not be-
cause there are two infinitives
(esse and vivere—one idea in
two forms), but because the abl.
absol. contains several ideas which
are also anticipated by the writer
