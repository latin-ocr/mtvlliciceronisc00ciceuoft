28. 3. Omnino: Knapp, Proceedings Am. Phil. Assoc. 1898, p. v,
makes sed tamen refer to orator metuo ne, etc., while he thinks Omnino
looks backward as a correction, and not forward to sed tamen, which is
squarely against the usual practice with omnino . . . sed tamen. Cf.
Knapp in CR. 14 (1900), 214, in explanation and confirmation of the
article just cited. Cf. also Anz. Msn. (p. 65) classes this with the
refutatio which begins with a concession3 but here the thing conceded
is not the thing charged. Cf. A.J.P. 23, 436-437.—sp1endescit: for
this Hennings (Fleck. Jb. 147, 781-2) conj. s(u)plendescit, i.e. *sub-
lentescit (cf. Barendt in CR. 13 (1899), 4023 14 (1900), 356). Others
have felt the difficulty of retaining splendescz't,—a difficulty which
appears to be satisfactorily met by the explanation in the commentary.
Sb.¹2 approves Henning⁷s conj. (though preferring his own subteme-
escit), but retains splendesczffi in the text.

one of his MSS. (Gen2) has compta, while BGen¹Hl have the corrupt
dzlrsertzls sermonibus coacta. Hence the probability that cocta is the
true reading (composita does not occur among the vv. ll. of Nonius).
Itis usual to defend compta by certain passages in Quintilian (10, 1,
79), Seneca (Ep. 75, 6), and Tacitus (Ann. 6, 153 Hist. 1, ῐ9); but
in all of these instances the word implies more of rhetorical finish than
is in keeping with the present passage.
