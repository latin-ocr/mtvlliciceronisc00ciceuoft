INTRODUCTION

no one of which, however, may be quite compared with it
in authority—have been collated and described in the
following critical works : —

Dahl, Zur Handsclzriftenkunde u. K rz'tz'k des ciceronisclten Cato Maior,
Christiania, 1885-1886.

Gemoll, Zwei neue Hdss. zu Ciceros Cato Maior, in Hermes, 20, 1885,

de V2z5523xffhzratzbnes Palaeograplzzkae, Leyden, 1889.

Ramorino, in Rz'vista di leology‘a, 15, 1886-1887, pp. 247 ff.

⁷ Clark, Collatinus from tlte Harleian MS. os Cicero, 2682, in Anecdota

0xon., 1892, class. ser. 1, pt. 7.

51. Dahl has given a new collation of P, besides several
other MSS. at Paris, thus : —

Pa = Parisinus, 5752 [Puteanus], tenth century, agreeing oftener with
P than with L, second hand based on P.

Vi = Victorinus, 14,699‚ from the abbey of St. Victor, eleventh century,
agreeing frequently with P, but often with L.

Pb = Parisinus, 6364, fourteenth century, with many omissions and
transpositions.

Sss = Sangermanensis, 13,340, twelfth century, a few readings only.

To Dahl and Gemoll we are indebted for the readings
of two more Leyden Mss. :—

V = Voss. Lat. O. 79, tenth century (ninth‚ Chatelain, de Groot)‚ more
closely related to P than to L3 the second hand is based upon P.
This is a Ms. of great value.1

v = Voss. Lat. F. 104, thirteenth century (Dahl), or fourteenth (Ge-
moll), related to L.

To de Vries for another Paris Ms. :—

A = Ashburnhamensis, ninth century, of the same family with L, and
among the best of our Mss.

¹ A supplementary collation of V by de Groot appeared in Hermes‚'25,
1890, pp· 293 ff-
