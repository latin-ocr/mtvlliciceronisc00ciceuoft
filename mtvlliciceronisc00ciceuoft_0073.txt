CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[§7

interfui querellis aequalium meorum (pares autem vetere
proverbio cum paribus facillime congregantur), quae C.
Salinator, quae Sp. Albinus, homines consulares, nostri
fere aequales, deplorare solebant, tum quod voluptatibus
carerent, sine quibus vitam nullam putarent, tum quod

spernerentur ab eis a quibus essent coli soliti.

Qui mihi

non id videbantur accusare quod esset accusandum. Nam
si id culpa senectutis accideret, eadem mihi usu venirent
reliquisque omnibus maioribus natu, quorum ego multorum 10
cognovi senectutem sine querella, qui se et libidinum vin-
culis laxatos esse non moleste ferrent nec a suis despiceren-

tur.

age is due to his experience of the
world, and the mistaken views it
often holds—2. pares: the prov-
erb also has the form similes si-
milibus coniungi solent, similibus
similia gaudent, and others3 but
the idea is as old as the Odyssey,
17, 218.—3. quae . . . deplorare
solebantz to recall (after the pa-
renthesis) the thought expressed
in Saepe . . . querellis,· quae is acc.
of the inner object3 H. 409, 1 3 L.
¹1443 A. 238, b; G. 333, 1, n. 23
B. 176, 2. Even without the pa-
renthesis the anacoluthon would
probably have occurred, for con-
tinuing with quas, one encounters
the difficulty that there is no
phrase in common use in which
querella (or a pron. to which it
is antecedent) is made the object
of a verb of uttering or expressing.
—5. quod . . . carerent . . . sper-
nerentur: the reason is stated on
their authority. In many cases

Sed omnium istius modi querellarum in moribus est

it would be carere se dicerent,-
cf. on senserim, 4, 4. —6. nullam:
cf. ad Fam. 7, 1, 4: lmc tempore
vita nullast, i.e. ⁴ no sort of a life.'
Also of persons, as Ter„ Phorm.
942: Nullus sum, ‘am done for.⁷
-—7. Qui: i.e. Sed lul—8. vide-
bantur: both were long since dead
at the time of the dialogue. —-
9. id: under the influence of id
in 1. 8, whereas in eadem he is
brought back to the two grounds
of complaint, voluptatibus carere
and sperni. — 10. quorum: de-
pending on mulionum—11. sine
querella: ⁴ uncomplaining.' At-
tributive phrases with prepositions
are not very common, except with
cum and sine (cf. 40, 2 : cum hosti-
bus . . . colloquia), or when the
order of words shows the attribu·
tive relation.-13. moribus: Latin
had no special word for ‘char-
acter‚' but employed usually mores
(always in the plural) ς much
