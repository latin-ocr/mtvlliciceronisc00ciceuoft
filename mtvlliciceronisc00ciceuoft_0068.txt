M. TVLLI CICERONIS

qui pareat omne tempus aetatis sine molestia possit

degere.

3. Sed de ceteris et diximus multa et saepe dicemus;

hunc librum ad te de senectute misimus.

Omnem autem

sermonem tribuimus non Tithono, ut Aristo Ceus (parum
enim-esset auctoritatis in fabula), sed M. Catoni seni, quo
5 maiorem auctoritatem haberet oratio. Apud quem Laelium
et Scipionem facimus admirantes quod is tam facile senec-

juxtaposition of two relatives, or
a relative pronoun and a rela-
tive adverb or relative conjunction
(eg. cum), is frequent in Latin,
but often forced and unnatural in
modern English3 cf. 13, 133 22,
6.—11. possit: that the clause
cui . . . possit is a character-
istic clause (rather than causal)
is shown by the ease with which
cuius consultus, and the like,
could be substituted for cui qui
pareat.

3. ceteris: neut.; philosophi-
cal subjects are meant, eg. the
nature of the gods (de Natura
Deorum), the question whether
death is an evil or not, or whether
virtue alone is sufficient for a
happy life (Tusculan Disputa-
tions).—1. saepe: τῖε. no change
is contemplated in his pians for a
series of philosophical works.—
2. misimus: epistolar-y perf„ ‘am
sending.'-2. Omnem: because
the sermo is not to be a conversa-
tion, in which the three speakers
really discuss old age, but a
speech by Cato. This form of
nomina! dialogue was used by

62

Aristotle.—3. Tithono: the last
person in the world of fact or
fable to make men wish to roech
old age, or to console those already
aged and decrepit; a weightier
reason for rejecting Aristo's choice
than that given in the text. Cic-
ero's friend Varro named one of
his satires Tithonus, the subJect
being old age—4. fabula: the
sense of ‘myth' is made to in-
clude ⁴ mythical character ' also. —
4. seni serves to distinguish the
old censor from his descendant,
Cato of Utica. Men of a former
generation are sometimes mlled
senes,· cf. Brutus, 39³ and per·
haps Horace, Sat. 2, 1, 34 (of
Lucilius).—5. maiorem: not in
comparison with the words of a
Tithonus, but with a discourse
in the person of Cicero himself,
or of a contemporary-3 cf. Inna,
ξς 3-5.—5. Apud quem: theonly
reference to the scene of the dia-
logue.—6. facimus: osten used

of poets and other writers, and ’

their treatment of characters3 cf.
54, 6.—6. admirantes: ef. 4, 13
of admiration as expressed in
