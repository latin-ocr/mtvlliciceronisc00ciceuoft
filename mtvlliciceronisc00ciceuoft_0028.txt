CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

19. Unable to think of a man of such keenness of in-
tellect as otherwise than open-minded toward Greek phi-
losophy and history, Cicero represents Cato as thoroughly
at home in the historical literature of the Greeks,¹ and
eminently sympathetic in his treatment of their philoso-
phy;2 and this in spite of certain hard facts, whereby
Cato -left on record his contempt of Greek philosophers,
his orthodox dread of their teachings‚ and his violent an-
tipathy to everything foreign.3

20. Equally unable to conceive of an original and pro-
ductive writer who drew no inspiration from the poetS,
Cicero makes his ideal Cato quote incessantly from poetry.
Yet the real Cato was a despiser of verse, and evidently
regretted the good old days in which all men thought of
poetry as an employment for idlers, little better than im-
moderate feasting.4 It should be said, however, that this
habit of profuse quotation from the poets is only one of
many respects in which the style of the present dialogue
shows itself to be the same as that employed by Cicero
in other works of a similar character.

21. With the best efforts to find reminiscences of Cato’s
own manner in the language of Cicero, the commentators
have failed to discover more than a very few instances in
which one may even suspect a conscious archaism.⁵ But we
