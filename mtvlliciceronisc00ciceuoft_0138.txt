M. TVLLI CICERONIS

10 beatior quam media, quod auctoritatis habebat plus, laboris
minus; apex est autem senectutis auctoritas.

61. Quanta fuit in L. Caecilio Metello, quanta in
Α. Atilio Calatino! in quem illud elogium : —

Hunc unum plurimae consentiunt gentes
Populi primarium fuisse virum.

5 Notum est totum carmen incisum in sepulcro.

Iure igitur

gravis, cuius de laudibus omnium esset fama consentiens.

with the extraordinary number of
consulships, and the long interval
between the first and the last.—
9. atque: introducing the transi-
tion to a new subject, z·.e. auctori-
tas (61—64). —9. huius: ‘in his
case.'— 10. auctoritatis : the weight
carried by his opinion on any public
question, his influence, and the re-
spect he commanded. — 11. apex:
i.e. ‘crown'3 corona is not found
in this figurative sense, and apex

l so used is very rare. Literally it

was the spike of olive-wood on the
flamen's cap.

61. Quanta fuit: 'the exclama-
tory mode of citing examples3 so
below, l. 7: Quem virum, etc.—
2. elogium: ἐλεγεῖον, Latinized3
here in its most usual sense, of an
inscription on a tomb; also used
of an inscription on the pedestal
of a statue.— 3· Hunc unum: the
inscription in the old Saturnian
metre is very similar to the extant
epitaph of L. Cornelius Scipio,
grandfather of Africanus, which, if
modernized (as in the text) would
read : --

Hunc unum plurimi consentiunt
R[0mam']
Bonorum optimum fuisse virum,

——six verses in all, the probable

'number for she inscription in the

text; cf. C.I.L. 1. 323 Fin. 2,116. '
—3· gentes: τῖε. ‘clans' (patri-
cian); but the expression oom-
prehends all good Romans, as in
the Scipio inscription3 cf. omnium
below, l. 6. -4. Populi: with pri-
marium virum. — 5. totum: six or
seven verses at most. -5, carmen:
i.e. elogzum. — 5. incisum: early
Roman epitaphs were painted on
the stone in red, — a custom which
survived among the poor even
down to Christian times, sor in the
catacombs many such are found
(on tiles). Engraving was the
practice by the time of Cato, but
the letters were often colored red.
— 5. sepulcro: on the Appian
Way near the Porta Capena, not
far from other celebrated family
tombs, as those of the Scipioe‚
Metelli, Servilii (Τ. D. 1, 13: Fin.
l.c.).—6. gravis: ‘a man of
