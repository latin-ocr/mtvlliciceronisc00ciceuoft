M. TVLLI CICERONIS

5 terea quae Socrates supremo vitae die de inmortalitate ani-
morum disseruisset, is qui esset omnium sapientissimus

oraculo Apollinis iudicatus.

Quid multa? sic mihi per-

suasi, sic sentio, cum tanta celeritas animorum sit, tanta
memoria praeteritorum futurorumque prudentia, tot artes,
ιο tantae scientiae, tot inventa, non posse eam naturam quae
res eas contineat, esse mortalem, cumque semper agitetur
animus nec principium motus habeat, quia se ipse moveat,

as an emanation from the divine
soul; cf. Phaedo, 86, 92—94. —
5. supremo . . . die: in the prison,
before taking the hemlock. —
5. de inmortalitate animorum: as
reported in Plato's Phaed03 aeter-
nitas animorum (not animi) was
also used for ‘immortality of the
soul ’ς cf. Τ. D. 1, 39, and aeterni-
tati above, 77, 10. —7. oraculo
Apollinis: at Delphi. The ques-
tion asked of the Pythia was
whether any man was wiser than
Socrates; her answer‚ μηδένα σο-
φώτερον εἶναι (Plato, Apol. 21 A).
—7. Quid multa? note the transi-
tion to the beliefs Cato has him-
self accepted. It is not to be
inferred that they had all been
borrowed from Plato, still less
from the Phaedo. The 3d and
4th only are from that dialogue3
the 1st is not from Plato at all,
but may represent a line of rea-
soning followed by his successors
in the Academy. Cf. App.; also
on 1. 20.—8. cum tanta. . .: this
lst “ proof'' from the unlimited ca-
pacities of the human mind Cicero

had used in T. D. 1, 59-65, 66
(from the Consolatio), with special
attention to memory and inven-
tion (cf. artes and inventa, 11. 9-
10), including poetry, eloquence,
and philosophy,—Prorsus hacc
divina mihi w'detur wir, quae tot
res efficiat et tantas (l.c. 65).—
8. celeritas animorum: cf. T. D.
1, 43: nulla est celeritas quae pos-
sit cum animi celeritate contendere.
— 10. scientiae: not ‘sciencae'
in the modern sense3 for the Latin
word never gets away from a per-
sonal association. The plural (only
here in class. Latin) is accounted
for by artes and inventa, and the
phrase may be translated ‘such a
range (tantae) of knowledge!—
11. cumque semper . . .: 2d argu-
ment, from the mind as a source of
motion; from Phaedrus, 245 C ff„
not from the Phaedo. It was used
by Cicero in Sonm. Sc. 27, 'and
quoted at length in T.D. 1, 53-54.
-- 11. agitetur ε middle in sense. ·—
12. principium motus : i.e. anything
outside of itself to give the first
impulse and set it in motion.—
