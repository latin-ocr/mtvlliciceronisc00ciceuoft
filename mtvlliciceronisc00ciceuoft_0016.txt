THE several stages, and the last stage. — The travelling by the
messenger, the procae'zccio in Italy. After a long journey, many
events, many hardships, many escapes, at last welcorne to Flor-
ence, Rome, Naples, or the place desired, the harbour, the end
of the voyage.

So of life. The end, the upshot, harbour, and port. All was
but to get well hither, all but to this end. — SHAFrEsBURY.
