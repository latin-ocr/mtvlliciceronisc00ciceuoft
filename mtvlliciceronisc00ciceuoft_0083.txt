CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[5 14-15

Annos septuaginta natus (tot enim vixit Ennius) ita fere-
bat duo quae maxima putantur onera, paupertatem et
senectutem, ut eis paene delectari videretur.

15. Etenim cum complector animo, quattuor reperio
causas cur senectus misera videatur, unam quod avocet a
rebus gerendis, alteram quod corpus faciat infirmius, ter-
tiam quod privet omnibus fere voluptatibus, quartam quod

haud procul absit a morte.

Earum, si placet, causarum

quanta quamque sit iusta una quaeque, videamus.

* sor legis Cinciae, 10, 11 3 Cato was

always in favor of measures to
restrict luxury, especially among
women; cf. Intr.‚ ξ 26. A frag-
ment of this speech remains (Gel-
lius, 17‚ 6, 1). The oration was
extant in the time of Livy's epito-
mator (per. 41), Le. perhaps in the
fourth century.-— 13. maxima . . .
onera, paupertatem et senectutem:
a proverb3 Otto, op. cit. p. 269.
15. Etenim: ‘ and in fact,' ‘and
indeed' (not ‘ for ') from the older
affirmative, rather than from the
inferential‚ meaning of enim. The
word is very frequently used by
Cicero, not to introduce proof of
what has just been said, but to add
another argument on the general
question under discussion, just as
porro and praeterea are used;
hence, appropriate to the begin-
ning of a fuller discussion of the
theme, and the transition from
the introduction to the argument
proper.— 1. complector: the un-

expressed object is the whole
question of age and its burdens. —
2. unam . . . alteram . . . tertiam:
where the total number of heads
had been first stated (quattuor), it
was customary in the enumeration
to use nnus in place of primus,
and alter for secundum cf. T. D.

Krebs, Antz'barbarus,⁶ 2, p. 345.
—2. avocet . . . faciat: the mood
in itself suggests that a refutation
of these arguments of others is to
be looked for from Cato. —3. re-
bus: τῖε. from activity in general,
but especially—as was natural for
a Roman— from cares of state and
command in the field. In reality
Cicero feels keenly the contrast
between his own present retire-
ment and the time when he held
the gubernacula rei publicae (de
Div. 2, 3).—4. fere usually fol-
lows the word it qualifies, espe-
cially if a negative, a numeral, or
omnam—6. quanta: τῖε. Cato will
take the measure of each argu-
