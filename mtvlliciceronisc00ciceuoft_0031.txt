INTRODUCrION

Polybius, at least five years of service were required be-
fore a man could be elected tribunus militum, while ten of
the twenty-four tribunes must show ten years of service.l
It is thus more likely that Cato, who had neither name nor
influence, was obliged to serve in the Tanks for ten years,
bringing his tribuneship down to the year 207, the year
ever memorable as that in which Hasdrubal was defeated
by Livius Salinator and Claudius Nero at the Metaurus.
Cato shared the hardships of Nero's forced marches from
Apulia to Umbria, gained distinction in the battle,2 and
marched away with his men the same night, to reach the
camp at Canusium in five days.

time he had already gained reputation as a speaker, and
was well known in the Roman law-courts. We are told
that his entrance upon this career was due to L. Valerius
Flaccus, a patrician, who had an estate near the Sabine
farm of Cato. Good reports of his neighbor's industry
and frugal living, as also of his activity in petty law-cases
in the nearest towns, led Flaccus to make the acquaint-
ance of Cato, and to persuade him that Rome offered a
larger field for his abilities.³ But we are not informed as
to when this removal to Rome took place. It is scarcely

before he became a soldier at seventeen. Nor is it easy
to imagine an interval in his military service, which would
allow him the time to win distinction at the bar. But with
the quaestorship, at thirty (204), he entered upon his pub-
lic' career, a name already honored and feared. Assigned
to duty with Scipio in the war in Africa, he saw much to
