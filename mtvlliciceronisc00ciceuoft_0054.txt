CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

To Ramorino for the readings of three MSS. in the Lau-
rentian library at Florence. The oldest of these is:—

M (Ram.‘s Ma) = Laurentianus L. 45, eleventh century, a ΜΒ. related
to P and V.

To Clark for collations of a celebrated MS. of a consid-
erable part of Cicero, formerly in the cathedral library at
Cologne, now in the British Museum : —

H z Hmleianus, 2682, eleventh century. The first hand usually agrees
with P, the second with L. In a number of cases H supplies MS.
authority for the conjectures of editors to whom it was unknown.

52. ΑΗΖ, in the edition named below (1st ed.), gave
some readings of : —

ΒΓ z Bruxellensis, Brussels, tenth century, related to L.1

Equal in age with the oldest Mss. of the Cato Maior,
but disappointing in its critical value, is ε —

K = Hadoardus' collection of excerpts from Cicero, including a con-

siderable part of this dialogue. This has been published by

Schwenke in Philologus, Suppl. 5, 399 ff. The MS. is in the Vati-
can (Vat. Reg. Suee„ 1762, ninth century).

Another Ms. (twelfth century) of the Benedictine library
at Admont‚ in Styria‚ has been collated by Petschenig
(Wiener Studien, 12, 1890, 321 ff). This Admontensis
(Ad) is closely related to Halm’s BIS.

53. Of critical essays and notes, a number are cited in
the Appendix. Worthy of separate mention in this place
are :—

A. Otto, Die Interpolatz·0nen in Ciceros Cato Maior, in Philologv'schc
Abhandlungen Martin Hertz u. s. w. dargebracht, Berlin, 1888,
pp. 94—104‚ in part a defence of the vulgate against the attacks os : —

Liitjohann‚ in Rlzeim'sches Museum, 37, 496-505, and

Meissner, in Fleckeisen's Jahrbic'clter, 131, 209—220.

¹ Thoe principal readings of this MS. are also given by Kornitzer (v. below).
