NOTES CRITICAL AND SUPPLEMENTARY

For the MSS.. see the following sections of the Introduction (pp. 46-48): A, 513
Ad. 52: B.49; Br, 52; E. 49; H. 51: 1.49: K. 521 L. 50; M‚51: ΝΡ.49;
Papb, 51: Q, 503 RS. 49: SngVI, 51; for text-criticism and editions¹ ἑᾷ 53-55ς
also the preface. Colb (ertinus) is another of Dahl's Paris MSS. (6105).

1. 1. ego: so LHVvVi rell.‚ ML, while P alone has te‚· the latter pre-
ferred by Hm„ Bt.‚ Sb.—adiuvero LPHV'2E'2M1, adiuto V1vBRSPb1
ΜΞ, adiuero A, but Lambinus, Hm., ML, etc., had already restored this
rdg. by conj. The reading ⁸of the text had been regularly rejected by
the edd. on the ground that there was no such form as adiuvere. But
it now appears that suij. (or opt.) forms of the sigmatic aorist sustain
the best Mss. here, and in Plaut.‚ Rudent, 3o5; Ter.‚ Phormio, 537;
Catullus, 66, 18. For the suggestion that this rdg. be restored to the
text the ed. is indebted to Professor Oertel, of Yale University.— levasso
oodd.; LvVi substitute levavero, a gloss3 H has levabo.

2. versat in pectore: in Pbl versatur pectore.

3. Ecquid erit praemi? om. P, except as inserted in marg. in an
abbreviated form, certain to be misunderstood. Hence the corruption
into et qua deprimeris in A2V2ViBIS‚ all the fifteenth century MSS.
(Dahl, 2, p. 17), and many of the early printed editions.

6. Ille vir: Cicero has probably taken slight liberties with Ennius's
verses, both here and at l. 8: sic.

9. non cognomen solum codd„ cognomen non solnm PPvaViBIS.

12. Quarum . . . nunc: the punctuation is that of Schiche and Anz
(except that the latter begins a paragraph with Quarum).

14. visum est mihi P, milti est visum L*AVvV E all.

2. 3. etiam L, om. all., Hm.

3—7. etsi te . . . uteretur: perhaps an addition in the process of
revision, cf. A. Otto, p. 95.

4. certo LP2RV÷A2‚ Charisius, 206 K„ Ml., certe P1HBESA1M‚ Hm.

ιο. digne satis laudari LHA²VEV³K‚ Ml., satis digne laudari Pb,
laudari satis digne P, Hm„ satis laudari dagne BRSM.
