CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

days, before his death (149),¹ —was that of Ser. Sulpicius
Galba, charged with breaking his promises to certain Lusi·
tanians who had surrendered, only to be killed, or sold into
slavery.2 It was even more of a tribute to the vigor of
his aged opponent than a confession of guilt, when Galba,
whom Cicero rates as the leading orator of the day,3 threw
himself upon the mercy of the people! Thus Cato’s public
activity continued to the very end. So often the accuser
of others, he was himself accused nearly fifty times.⁵ Only
four years before his death he had been put upon trial for
the last time.⁶ On this occasion he had complained of the
difficulty of defending himself before another generation.⁷
Nestor-like, as Plutarch observes, he may be said to have
lived through three generations, from that in which the
most conspicuous figure was his bate noire, the great Scipio,
to that of Scipio Aemilianus, the destroyer of Carthage.
Had three years been added to his life, he would have seen
the final ruin of the power which had filled his youth with
dread, his maturet· years with a hate which no age could
sosten. In the length of one long life, Rome had ceased
to be an Italian state, and had become the arbiter, where
not the actual ruler, of the Mediterranean world, with an
inevitable career of unlimited expansion and conquest.
