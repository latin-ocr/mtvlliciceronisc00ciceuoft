CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[ἓ 1⁶

’ pacem cum Pyrrho foedusque faciendum, non dubitavit
dicere illa quae versibus persecutus est Ennius:

Quo vobis mentes, rectae qnae stare solebant
Antehac, dementis sese flexere viai?

ceteraque gravissime; notum enirn vobis carmen est ; et

tamen ipsius Appi exstat oratio.

Atque haec ille egit sep-

timo decimo anno post alterurn consulatum, cum inter duos
consulatus anni decem interfuissent censorque ante supe· 10

—3. pacem: cf. Val. Max. 8, 13, 5 :
Quin etiam fessus iam vivendo lec-
tica se in curiam deferri iussit, ut
cum Pyrrho deformem pacem fieri
prohiberet. An excellent parallel
would have been the blind old
Timoleon, of whom Nepos says:
Veniebat autem in theatrum (z'.e.
of Syracuse), cum ibi concilium
populi haberetur, propter valetu-
dinem vectus iumentis iunctis, atque
ita de vehiculo, quae videbantur,
dicebat (Tim. 4, 2). —4. persecu-
tus est: ‘has set forth.' In this
particular case the translation ⁴ has
reproduced' would be more precise,
for Ennius undoubtedly had the
text of Appius's speech before him.
— 5. mentes . . . dementis: ‘ senses
. . . now senseless'3 besides the
oxymoron, force is added by plac-
ing the two words in correspond-
ing emphatic positions‚ before the
mesura, and before and after a par-
enthetical clause. —6. Antehac:
dissyllabic, either by synizesis‚ or
by elision of e (ant'lzac). -6, de-
mentis: nom„ the rare early form.
-6. viii: old gen, (trisyllabic)

79

with Quo, as in ubi terrarum?
— 7. enim: elliptical 3 ‘ no need to
quote more, for,' etc.; cf. on 36, 5.
-7. carmen: locus (‘ passage ’)
would be expected, but a contrast
with oratio is desired.—-7. et ta-
men: ‘and for that matter.' --
8. oratio: this must have been in
a very quaint style, — dry and juice-
less reading for Cicero, as is clear
from Brutus, 61, but historically
of importance as the very begin-
ning of Latin prose, and so far in
advance of the time that Roman
literature is not considered to have
had any prose until Cato appeared ς
cf. Intr., ἐξ 34, 36.—9. cum . . .
interfuissent . . . fuisset: the cnm-
clauses have no other office here
than to take the place of missing
perfect participles 3 z'.e. the thought
is merely ‘having been consul for
the first time ten years earlier, and
censor even before that) Cf. fiale,
C unz—K onstrnktionen, pp. 222—22 3,
2²93 cf. on 30, 53 41, 14.—1o.
ante superiorem consulatum: con-
trary to the usual practice, by
which ex-consuls only were chosen
