CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[5 20

20. Apud Lacedaemonios quidem ei qui amplissimum
magistratum gerunt, ut sunt, sic etiam nominantur senes.
Quod si legere aut audire voletis externa, maximas res pub-
licas ab adulescentibus labefactatas, a senibus sustentatas

et restitutas reperietis.

Cedo, quz' vestram rem pziblz'cam tantam amisistis ta'm cito ?

Sic enirn percontantur Veientes in Naevi poetae Ludo;
respondentur et alia et hoc in primis :

Prove'nz‘ebant oratores novi, stulti adulescentuli.

Temeritas est videlicet florentis aetatis, prudentia sene· 10

regularly, in fact, when the senate
is meant.

20. 2. senes: whereas at Rome
senatores were distinct from senes,
the Spartans contented themselves
with the one word γέρων. — 3· ex-
terna: i.e. the history or experi-
ence of other peoples. The mention
of one foreign state suggests the
lessons of universal history3 cf.
12, 9.—6. cedo: old imperative
sing. of dare, 2d pers. ; plural cette
(*ce-d(i)te). The verse is an iam-

referred to is possibly the Etruscan
Veii (Vei), only a dozen miles
north of Rome. Another frag-

play, according to some) intro-

p. 20.—7. veientes: objeet3 the
subject is omitted as immaterial
for the present purpose. Veii was
the nearest of Rome’s Etruscan
rivals, and a much stronger city,
at the time of its capture, 396 13.c.,
than Rome itself. According to
Livy, 5, 1, 3, the people of Veii
had abandoned aristocracy for the
rule of a king in 403. Cf. App.
—7. Ludo: T lte Etruscan, the
name of a play. This was a prae-
texta, i.e. a national or Italian
tragedy, a form of literature of
which Naevius was the originator,
in distinction from tragoedia, which
was imitated from the Greek. The
play may have dealt with the siege
of Veii, thus glorifying Rome in
the downfall of her nearest enemy.
Cf. App.—8. et alia et: a com-
mon formula for ‘among other
things.'-—9. Proveniebant: in the
same metre as above, a part of the
