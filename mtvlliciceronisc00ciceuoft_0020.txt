CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

to which he alludes could have been matched by Varro.
(3) In the third stage of the argument (§ 39 ff.)‚ the whole
subject οἱ agriculture, upon which he enlarges at great
length, would fall away, and with it the special pertinency
of not a few of his illustrations. It is true that Varro was
an expert in this direction,'but his work on agriculture was·
not yet written, while Cato’s book on the same subject was a
classic. (4) In the more technical arguments with which
the fourth objection to old age is met (§ 66 ff.)‚ there is
nothing so personal to Cato that an adequate substitute
might not have been found, if the discourse had been put
in the mouth of another. And yet here, as in the intro-
ductory sections, and throughout the dialogue, while the
personal allusions or recollections may be no better for the
purposes of the essay than similar personalities connected
with another speaker, the total effect of them all could not
possibly be produced apart from the heroic figure of Cato.¹
The choice was in fact inevitable, and the brief dialogue
in which the old censor, the hater of all things Greek, is
made to stand as sponsor for the wisdom born to Cicero
out of Greek philosophy, is in no other direction so fruit-

’ ful as in the comparison it suggests between the uncouth

Roman of the older day, on the one hand, with all his
native vigor, his unique combination of wisdom with preju-
dice, greatness with meanness, and, on the other, the highly
cultivated, cosmopolitan, but less masculine, Roman of the
last days of the Republic.
