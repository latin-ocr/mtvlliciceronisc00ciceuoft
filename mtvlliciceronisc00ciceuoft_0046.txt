CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

was to be revived by a system which provides for nothing
but slave-labor, he neither asks nor answers.

44. To this outline of the works of Cato may be added
a single passage from one of his orations, as a specimen of
his style and an example of his Ciceronian praise of him-
self, though he endeavors in this case to disarm criticism
by an elaborate rhetorical figure. Cato has called for the
reading before the court of a speech written on a previous
occasion, —a general defence of himself. While disclaim-
ing any intention of glorifying his own conduct, he merely
interrupts the reader from time to time, bidding him omit
unwelcome truths and read on; but the next passage is
equally personal, and the next interruption, with all its
vigor, is a mere stage protest. It is cited by Fronto in a
letter to his pupil, Marcus Aurelius, as a striking example
of the figure called praeteritio. Omitting a few sentences
at the beginning ε -

‘ Numquam ego praedam, neque quod de hostibus captum
esset, neque manubias inter pauculos amicos meos divisi,
ut illis eriperem qui cepissent.’ Istuc quoque dele, nihil
minus volunt dici; non opus est recitato. . . . ‘ Numquam
ego argentum pro vino congiario inter apparitores atque
amicos me‘os disdidi, neque eos malo publico divites feci.'
Enim vero usque istuc ad lignum dele. ⁴ Videsis quo loco
res publica siet, uti quod rei publicae bene fecissem, unde
gratiam capiebam, nunc idem illud memorare non audeo,
ne invidiae siet. Ita inductum est male facere inpoene‚
bene facere non inpoene licere.’ ¹

¹ For the full text of the passage see Fronto, Epist. ad Antonin. Imperat.

1, 2, Naber, pp. 99-100 ; Jordan, p. 37; the speech was entitled de Sumpta
Suo.
