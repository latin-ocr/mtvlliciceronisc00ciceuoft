CATO MAIOR DE SENECTVTE

[ἓ 50

50. Quid in levioribus studiis, sed tamen acutis? quam
gaudebat Bello suo Punico Naevius! quam Truculento
Plautus, quam Pseudolo! Vidi etiam senem Livium; qui,
cum sex annis ante quam ego natus sum fabulam docuisset
Centone Tuditanoque consulibus, usque ad adulescentiam 5

meam processit aetate.

omne posterum tempus, quae,
quantae (i.e. the degree of to-
tality), quando futurae sint ‚· cf.
Dz’v. 2, 17). They were also
calculated backwards to the sup-
posed time of Romulus (Rep. 1,
25 fin.).

50. levioribus: as of less value
for the patriotie and unselfish
citizen. Cicero (still more Cato)
disapproved of all occupations
which turned a man's attention
away from public duties. Galus
had avoided a too extreme devo-
, tion to his astronomy (Off. 1, 19).
Even the quest os truth must not
withdraw the student from state
affairs3 cuius studio (sc. veri in·-
vestigatio) a rebus gerendis abduci
contra officium est ‚· Off l.c. ; cf.
ib. 154.——1. acutis: an unexam-
’ pled use of the word with studia.
Commonly acutus denotes a keen-
ness or sharpness acquired by
training or effort3 acer, a natural
keenness. Hence -— in a different
figure—acuta studia would be
pul-suits or occupations already
brought to a high state of cultiva-
tion by the labors of predecessors
in the same field, so that no
dullard could hope for success.

Quid de P. Licini Crassi et ponti-

——2. Bello . . . Punico: an epic
poem on the 1st Punic war, with
the early history of Rome and
Carthage, divided by the gram-
marians into seven books. The

,metre was the native Saturnian. —

2. Truculento: one of the twenty
extant comedies of Plautus, per-
formed about five years before the
censorship of Cato.— 3. Pseudolo:
also extant3 performed 191 B.C.
at the dedication of the temple of
Cybele on the Palatine3 cf. on
45, 3—4.—-3. senem: ‘in his old
age'3 cf. on 1. 9 below.—-4. cum
. . . docuisset: participial in force3
cf. on 41, 143 cf. Hale, op. cit. p.
228. The fact and the date are
mentioned because the year 240
marked an era in the history of
Roman literature. The poet in
early times had to train (docere,
διδάσκειν) the performers, whether
he acted himself or not. Hence
fabulam docere is ‘to bring out
a play.'—6. aetate: not preg-
nant, for long life, but forming a
single idea with the verb processit,
‘lived on' or ‘down'3 cf. 21, 4.
—6. Quid . . loquar: cf. on 24, 1.
-6. pontificii. . . iuris: cf. 22,
