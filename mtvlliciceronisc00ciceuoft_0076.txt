M. TVLLI CICERONIS

IV. 10. Ego Q. Maximum, eum qui Tarentum recepit,
senem adulescens ita dilexi ut aequalem; erat enim in illo
viro comitate condita gravitas, nec senectus mores muta-
verat; quamquam eum colere coepi non admodum grandem

5natu, sed tamen iam aetate provectum. Anno enim post
consul primum fuerat quam ego natus sum, cumque eo ·
quartum consule adulescentulus miles ad Capuam profectus
sum, quintoque anno post ad Tarentum. Quaestor deinde
quadriennio post sactus sum, quem magistratum gessi con-
10 sulibus Tuditano et Cethego, cum quidem 'ille admodum

life, showing that in artes, l. 2, the
sense of ‘liberal arts,' ‘learning'
or ‘learned occupations' would be
out of place here.

10. Ego: to call attention to an
example known to the speaker of
a bene acta vita and its multa bene
facta. But Cato is represented as
unable to mention Fabius without
wandering from his proper sub-
ject into personal reminiscences,
which have little to do with the
subject, but serve to give an air
of reality to Cicero's portrait of
the old censor.—1. Tarentum:
in 209 B.c.; Hannibal had held
it since 212.—2. senem adu-
lescens: juxtaposition, a favorite
device with Greek and Roman
writers, both when the words con-
trast, as here, and when they are
only different forms of the same
word, or very closely related, eg.
alius alium, or Lucretius's casta
inceste (1, 98), or Suetonius's di-
misit, invitus invitam (Titus, 7).
-- 3. condita: not condita. —

4. quamquam: cf. on 1, 7.—4. ad-
modum: the English phrase ‘to
a degree' helps to show how ad-
modum takes on the meanings
‘very,' ‘quite,' ‘fully’3 with· a
subst., below l. 103 cf. 30, 23
46, 3.—5. Anno: ‘a year,' ‘one

year'3 not ‘in the year after,' ‘

which would be primo anno‚· cf.
19, 4. The date is 233 mc.—
7. quartum: 214 13.c.-7. adu·
lescentulus: in apposition with the
subj., while miles is predicate. He
was then in his twenty-tirsi year.
—7. ad Capuam: Capua being in
the hands of the enemy, it was
impossible for Fabius to do more
than approach the city; hence
the prep. So ad Tarentum, l. 8,
with the difference that his opera-
tions ended in the recapture of
the city.—9. quadriennio» his
quaestorship falls in the yoes 204.
— ιο. cum quidem ille: ‘ the γαπ,
by the way, in which.' On this
use of a clause with cum and the
indie, following the main clause,
