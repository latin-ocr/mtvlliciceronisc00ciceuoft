such fame as the historical work which claimed his time
for more than twenty years. Having no predecessors in
this field, except the few half—Romans who had written in
bad Greek, Cato set himself the task of creating a prose
style capable of adapti-ng itself to the varied requirements
of history on a large scale. He aims to rescue his mother
tongue from the reproach of having no prose, while poetry
is scornfully left to the Greeks and their admirers. Albinus,
one of the most tactless supporters of Greek culture, had
dedicated to the poet Ennius a history of Rome in Greek.2

books were from time to time added. The fourth book

this is doubtful. Nowhere else ‹lo we find the party strife so distinctly men-
