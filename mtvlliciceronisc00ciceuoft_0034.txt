CATO MAIOR DE SENECI'VTE

At Thermopylae, Cato led a detachment around the pass
by the same path which had been used by the Persians,
and enabled Glabrio to dislodge Antiochus.l To the com·

detached and sent to Rome to report the victory, which he
did with all possible speed, covering the distance by land,
between Hydruntum and Rome, in five days.2

camp of Antiochus. Cato appeared as a witness, to the
confusion and retirement of Glabrio, who had the satisfac-

was perhaps in large measure due to the virulence of Cato;
for the latter took a prominent part in bringing Scipio
